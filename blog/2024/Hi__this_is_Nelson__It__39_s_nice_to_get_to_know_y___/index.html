It’s nice to get to know your blog (again?) and read some nice posts about your life. I haven’t visited Hong Kong for some reasons, but I frquently see stuff about Hong Kong, especially after I became more active on the new social platform Threads recently.</p> <p>I read about the transportation and business culture of Hong Kong. I learned that the transportation fee in London is spiking. Hong Kong is considered expensive, but London is on another level lol. (London is really an expensive city for me so far.) Shops in Hong Kong tend to have fixed opening hours and fewer days closed compared to them in Taiwan. Some people say it’s just because Hong Kong people love money lol. But one can argue that Taiwan is convenient enough with many convenience stores opening 24/7 and different shops opening until late hours or on weekends. What do you think? :)</p> </body></html>

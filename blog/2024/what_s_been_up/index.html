<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I haven’t blogged a lot lately. There’s been reasons for that. One is that with my upcoming move, there’s a lot of things to think about. Booking travel plans, vaguely applying for jobs. Packing up my stuff in Taiwan, saying goodbye to friends. I’ve also been trying to back-up my laptop, organize my personal photos and videos. In my free time, I’ve been trying to build a new website for the 20th time to no avail but I’ll get there. I’ve also been experimented with building applications with large language models – like ideally an interface to chat with this blog! It’s all on the list of “want to dos”. Then, my friend Dean is visiting Taiwan, and we went to the Rainbow Gathering last week, and I showed him around Kaohsiung (mainly the sports store, Decathalon). So that’s what’s been up.</p> <p>Some recent developments:</p> <p>Obsidian. I really like this tool for note organization. That means like my weekly todo lists, my journal, in the future I want to write blog posts in that. It’s cool because it’s all Markdown (ie. text-based) notes so there’s no company holding onto my data. It’s also extensible – there’s like a thousand plugins to add whatever feature you want to the software. So I like it.</p> <p>Backups. I had to decorrupt a USB drive</p> </body></html>

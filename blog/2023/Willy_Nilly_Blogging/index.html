That is, not thinking too hard about something before publishing and sharing it with the world. This blog is a good example of this. Tyler Cowen literally blogs twice a day. A prolific thought producer, or at least excellent at writing thoughts down (and when thoughts are written down, they turn into ideas). I support this but in actuality my blogging is not that willy nilly; I’ve only blogged every month or two the past year. But I just had a spark of inspiration – what if I could blog from my phone? Then I could blog from the Kaohsiung MRT, a Donutes coffee shop, or Jade Mountain. I’m not surprised to find that there’s an app for that. So that’s how I’m blogging now.</p> </body></html>

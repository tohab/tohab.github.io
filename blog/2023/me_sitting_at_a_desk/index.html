Sitting is important for lots of things like preparing for tests, having coffee with people, sending emails, journalling, etc. I enjoy those things and can tolerate sitting for a little bit like that. But when I think about the monumentous task of doing something for many hours at end, day after day at a desk it’s rather daunting. Sitting at end also has bad health effects on metabolism and such. It’s said (by me) that sitting might even be the new smoking.</p> <p>The exception to my dislike of sitting is when I’m reading a book I really like. I’ve recently been reading the Mistborn trilogy; a fantasy series about a magical feudal kingdom. There’s something about the escapism of fantasy that lets me forget everything else going and become obsessed with learning about the plot of the story. So maybe I can sit after all, I just need something enrapturing enough to do.</p> </body></html>

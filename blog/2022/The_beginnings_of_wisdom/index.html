For years I had seen it coming, it and its three siblingns. It emerged from the back of my mouth. It pained my head and ears and mouth and throat and made it hard to eat. And now, it is here. It makes me wonder – what left do I have in the realm of my dental development? And does this “wisdom tooth” really make me so wise? I think not… though some say that is the beginnings of wisdom.</p> </body></html>

On the other side, I have to accept I’m not a perfect utilitarian, saint, or money-making machine – which involves self-compassion and acceptance.</p> <p>Non-negotiable (must have): Work-life balance</p> <p>Top shelf (go hard at this): High impact, not sitting all day</p> <p>Middle shelf (don’t fail at this): Money to get by and have savings, in places where i have friends, related to my passions</p> <p>Bottom shelf (great to have, not at the expense of others): travel</p> <p>Trash can (resist this): slave at something i don’t care about, live in the same place my whole life, sit at a desk all day</p> <p>getting to a place</p> <p>we have to look at career with a growth mindset! for something like being a surgeon, this is obvious – you understand that even if you’ve never operated on someone before, you can be a surgeon at some point given effort and time. this is true, too, for other careers, like being an actor, author, or politician.</p> <p>the difference is that there’s more dimensions. authors have to be good at writing, certainly. but also, public speaking, persistently pestering publications, personal branding, long-term devotion to a book, and more I think. And once you’re good at all those things, it may still be a while till your books take off. Nonetheless, that’s how it is for almost all authors.</p> <p>Urban suggests we consider Progress = Pace x Persistence. Pace depends on your work ethic and natural ability. The former can certainly be improved. Persistence is the long-term game – pursuing your dream career for years and years, even after set-backs. A few years is not long enough – you must dedicate a lot of time to your passion to make it a reality.</p> <p>the career game, understanding:</p> <p>the general landscape of all careers ever specific game boards for careers i’m remotely interested instarting point in each onesuccess point – where would I feel happy?my pace. How much work am I willing to put into these paths? my persistence. How much would I be willing to put into these paths?This analysis is very useful for distinguishing between careers. For instance, I’d love to be a public intellectual and speak about math, economics, and social justice – but that very well might mean I have to get a PhD, suck up to professors, and grind for 6 years en route to that successful place. I may want to be a politician, but that means listening to wayyy too many people empathetically which is very difficult. If I want to be a writer, I know I’ve written a little bit already, but I haven’t published in newspapers recently or anything. But I enjoy writing and I think I’m good at it, so maybe I have some inherent advantage. Then again, how long could I put up writing failed books? I’m not sure. On the other hand, working in alternative proteins is easier, because it pays money so I could certainly spend more time trying to become successful – even as an entrepreneaur.</p> <p>but really</p> <p>test things out when you’re looking at careers. you can’t know if you’ll get along with someone based on the tinder bio, and same with a career. start with small test-runs, decide what you like and don’t like, and then test out something else. quit often, esp. when you feel like it. take on feedback, learn about the changing world.</p> </body></html>

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>This week I am planning to employ a version of “digital minimalism”. The goal of it is to redefine my relationship to technology, and to only use it in a way that serves my values.</p> <p>This idea comes from a computer science professor, Cal Newport, and a book he wrote called Digital Minimalism. He claims the way to do this is to cut out all digital devices from one’s life for a month (or so). After one experiences an entirely analog life, the Minimalist very gradually adds technology that clearly services their goals. For instance, if someone believed that Facebook bolstens their social life, they might realize after taking a break that they are perfectly happy contacting close friends through other means. Thus, they would not add Facebook back into their life. Without taking that first leap, however, the person wouldn’t realize that technology actually does a disservice to their life.</p> <p>We often believe that every single bit of technology we allow into our lives makes us happier. Many of my peers use AirPods, the Apple Watch, and other pervassive devices to be in constant connection with the world wide web. More time online, it is said, lets us read more, listen to more podcasts, connect with friends about last minute changes in plans. There is no perceived downside to the Maximalist’s way of life.</p> <p>In fact, this can be very destructive. I myself have noticed my attention span greatly reduced when I always have the choice to be online. I notice my ability to deepy introspect suffer when there is so much information available online. I notice that as my online presence grows, my presence in the real-world diminishes. A quote I once heard summmed this up well: “A wealth of information means a poverty of attention.”</p> <p>And so, I find it extremely important to take control of our minds. Our capacity to focus and be present is refined only when we are in completely in the real-world. A digital reality is not a reality at all, and any connections to the internet are potential sources of destruction for our lives.</p> <p>And yet I am hypocritical. I can’t really bring myself to eliminate all technology from my life, but this coming week is a dip in the water of life. My version of Digital Minimalism, from October 28th (Monday) to November 3rd (Sunday), is to:</p> <p>Not use my smart-phone for a week Only connect to internet on my laptop for 30 minutes each morning Only use email, BCourses, and a couple other essential websites during online time</p> <p>For people to contact me, I will respond to email once a day, and have a “brick” phone to mainly make and recieve calls (texting is hard on those things!).</p> <p>I am quite excited.</p> </body></html>

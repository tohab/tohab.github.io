Shall I compare thee

To a mush-a-room?

Whose earthy presence

Roasts deliciously. 



Rich in vitamin

And in heart

Your strength to grow 

When we're apart.



You grew on me,

And the tomatoes in the fridge,

Slow at first but suddenly

My fridge was full of you.



At times you have me truffled

With a magic sort of trance

I turn to spirituality 

As you make me want to dance.



Deep in earth you may bring light

To Mario, you bring sensation

To me you bring scrumptiousness 

In one bulbous creation.

*This was originally posted on blogger.*
I flick my wrist and strike the ball with a satisfying *tut*. *Score,*I think, but *jìaolìan,* my coach, doesn't agree. *Búdùi* he says. Wrong. He shows me the stroke one more time.  
Just about everything in ping pong can be put into the *duì* (correct) or búdùi (incorrect) classification. My coach is a math teacher at a *bǔxíbān*, a cram school, which maybe means he's especially familiar with what's wrong and right. My footwork is *búdùi* (if you're moving right, you should move the left foot first). My posture is *búdùi*, I'm standing too upright. My hand grips the racket completely *búdùi*-ly. "The fundamentals of ping pong are very important," my coach unhelpfully adds, and he sends another ball my way.  
There are moments, precious few, when I hit the ball in a non-objectible manner. "OK," he says. *OK* is a special loan-word in Taiwanese Mandarin -- in American English it might translate as, "well done!" or "fantastic!!" or "you're a star student!!!" In Chinese, they don't waste the breath.  
My coach hits the ball back with startling precision. I put all the force I can muster on some of the "OK" balls but my coach sweeps his hand back exactly right so I can do it all again.   
In my fourth group lesson I notice my coach playing with his left hand.  
"Coach, you're not a leftie, are you??"   
"I can do both," he says nonchalantly. He explains later, "I'm right-handed, but I realized my form on my right-hand was often *búdùi*, so I trained with my coach on the left," like what he did was the most sensical thing in the world. "The fundamentals of ping pong are very important."

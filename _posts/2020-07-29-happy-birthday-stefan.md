title: Happy Birthday Stefan!
---


*There once was a young Homentcovschi,**Whose legs were quite long and lanky.**He sure loved the snow**And skied like a pro**But off-season Stefan became cranky.**At the old age of twenty,**Stefan's joints ached aplenty**So he looked hard at worms**To age on his terms**And [lysosomal secrets](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/26/eaaz9805.full.pdf) were found to his glee**Some days Stefan plays bio-engineer**Other times he is a fine mountaineer!**A cooker of chille**He's really quite silly,**He'll rick-roll you on trumpet for [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzXXHVhGXTQ)**On this fine day we'll celebrate**He who's my friend and roommate**In summery July**Thirty upon nigh**We honor this Homentcovschi's birth-date.*

"We know how the universe ends... and Earth has nothing to do with it. We blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers," explains the guide. To most reasonable Tralfamadoreans the response to that is "So it goes."



Time, life, and death to these aliens doesn't follow a straight path, or any path at all. Instead, the Tralfamadoreans see time like we see a mountainous landscape. All at once, always there. No beginnings, no ends, though some people may be experiencing a particular part, or choose to go in a particular direction. The Tralfamadoreans advice to Billy Pilgrim, a war veteran and master of optometry, is simply to ignore the bad times and focus on the good ones. That way you'll always be happy. Trying to change what happens in the future is like me trying to ski away from the bunny slopes. Impossible and very dangerous if attempted.



Billy Pilgrim somehow doesn't get this in his head, because he always manages to come unstuck in time. Every crash, smash, or bang brings him back to those moments when he was captured by the Germans. In fact, he still is captured by the Germans, in the Tralfamadorean sense. We never see real protest from Billy -- he goes along with his life, no matter where or when it takes him.



Yet the protest comes in other forms. Take one time, an hour before the Tralfamadoreans abducted Billy -- he had some time to kill. He was watching a movie about brave Americans in World War Two bombing fiendish Germans. Except Billy become unstuck in time, and saw it backwards. Instead of a story of war we see a story of peace and reconciliation. American planes suck up fire from a devestated German city and heal it with magical powers. They fly away and back to their country, get disassembled by women working in factories, and their parts shipped to remote areas. "It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again."

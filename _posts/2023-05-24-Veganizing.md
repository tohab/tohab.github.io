When I first turned vegan I was 18. It was an exciting thing and I wanted to tell everyone about it. Ask me my favorite ice cream flavor and I would tell you, "anything's delicious so long as it's vegan!" I had a newfound confidence with companion animals because, well, I was vegan, and they knew it. Whenever I met another vegan I thought they were the shit, and we had tons in common.


After a few months I had a run-in with my then-girlfriend's good friend. She ate meat and I basically said that you're killing animals for no reason -- that's a bad thing to do. She got very defensive. She said I was an aggressive vegan. I had only heard rumors about this label before. When I was struck with it I was defensive and dismissive of her.Â 

A few months later I was inspired by the history of activism

brand themselves as disrupters, revolutionizing food. before vegans were preachy, lame. now they're cool, like snoop dog, serena williams, or novak djokovic. now, you can live in accordance with american values (see Obama's meatless dinner.)i worked in the innovation dpt, working with the chief of staff.Â  
part of me wonders if beyond meat is overselling itself. they thrive off hype, but it's ultimately just a fancy veggie burger. there's a way in which technology can create something new and change lives -- like the iphone -- but technology isn't solving that many issues. it just gives the tools too.ppl join beyond meat to liberate themselves from big food, but in many ways, it is a continuation, rather than disrupter, of american capitalism. ethan brown makes 8M$ a year, a couple hundred times your technician in a factory. competing with big ag, also trying to stay ahead of small start-ups in the food tech space.

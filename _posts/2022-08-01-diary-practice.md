七月五號   


今天我终于决定我必须要去外面跑步。在佛羅里達外面很热，所以直到今天以前，我一直打算去跑步但是我总是没出去。  
   
我晚上八点出去。当时，太陽還沒下山 (我媽不讓我晚上出門,因為她擔心我遇到蛇)。我跑地（得）有一點慢,因為我幾天沒運動了. 但是,我跑步途中,
開始下一點雨.我想一想, 這樣下雨不錯! 但是, 在佛羅里達一下雨上了, 就下得很厲害. 今天也不例外. 突然,
我的衣服看起來像我剛才去游泳! 哇塞.   
    下雨的時候去外面跑步有一些好處. 比方說, 我回家以後, 我不需要洗澡! 哈哈我開玩笑. 真的好處是: 第一, 天氣比較涼快, 所以我跑得比較快! 第二個好處是水坑讓我赤腳跑步比較舒服. 而且, 我回家時看到一隻青蛙!  
   
我跑步快結束的時候, 我看到雷電!. 我感到擔心. 我媽已經對蛇涉很感到可怕害怕/擔心, 她他對雷會怎麼想? 因此我趕緊 很快回家敲門.
我爸爸已經準備了一條毛巾歡迎我回家. 我叫我媽, "媽媽別著急!我安全得到家了!" 但是她沒聽到我, 因為她在外面, 高興地欣賞著雨!

Today
I finally decided that I have to go outside for a run. It's hot outside
in Florida, so until today I've been going for a run but I never get
out.

I
go out at eight o'clock at night. At that time, the sun had not yet set
(my mother would not let me go out at night because she was worried
that I would encounter snakes). I'm running a little slow because I
haven't exercised for a few days. However, during my run, it started to
rain a little. I think about it, it's raining good! Great. Today was no
exception. Suddenly, my clothes looked like I just went swimming! Wow.

Going
outside for a run when it's raining has some benefits. For example,
when I get home, I don't need to take a shower! Haha I'm joking. The
real benefits are: First, it's cooler, so I run faster! Second The good
thing is that the puddles make it more comfortable for me to run
barefoot. Also, I saw a frog when I got home!

Towards
the end of my run, I saw thunder and lightning!. I was worried. My mom
was already terrified/worried about the snake, what would she think of
thunder? So I hurried home and knocked on the door. My dad A towel had
been prepared to welcome me home. I called my mom, "Don't worry mom! I
got home safely!" But she didn't hear me because she was outside,
happily admiring the rain!

今天我想談談我跟乒乓球的關係. 聽說, 在大陸和台灣乒乓球是很熱門的運動. (中國人每次都贏乒乓奧運冠軍!)   
    我在倫敦時, 我父母買一個玩意兒, 他可以從餐桌變型成乒乓求桌! 很棒, 很方便, 所以我當時很經常打乒乓球. 本來, 我每天想跟我父母打乒乓球. 但是, 我的乒乓球進步很多, 所以我們一玩我每次都贏. 我很感謝我父母讓我有這樣的乒乓球的起源故事. (其實, 因為真的乒乓球桌比較大一點, 到今天, 用真的桌子我有一點不習慣).  
    有一天, 我請了我們的鄰居的男孩子來我家. 他叫約翰, 比我大一歲. 從那天起, 我們開很好朋友. 但是更重要的是: 他的乒乓球很厲害. 各個周末, 我們每天會花至少兩小時打乒乓球. 在他學校, 約翰也打乒乓球, 但是他的同學們打得還可以. 所以我們兩個是互相最強大的對手.  
    我們就像陰和陽. 他是左撇子, 我是右撇子. 他用旋轉球, 我用扣殺. 他的乒乓球拍很凹凸不平, 我的很光滑. 就這樣, 我們從七歲到十六歲切磋 (十六歲之後, 我們兩個都很忙, 就沒有很多時間玩乒乓球). 每次我們的比賽都差不多平分了. 這樣讓我們每次繼續 -- 下一次, 誰會呢？誰要贏了?  
    現在, 約翰住在英國, 我住在美國. 他還是我遇過最強大的乒乓球對手. 現在, 我只有一個夢想. 我希望我在台灣可以練習我的乒乓球. 之後我和約翰相遇, 我會贏的!

Today I want to talk about my relationship with table tennis. I heard that table tennis is a very popular sport in mainland China and Taiwan. (Chinese people win the table tennis Olympic championship every time!).

When I was in London, my parents bought something that could transform from a dining table to a ping pong table! It was great and convenient, so I played ping pong a lot at the time. Originally, I wanted to play ping pong with my parents every day. But , My table tennis has improved a lot, so I win every time we play. I am very grateful to my parents for letting me have such a table tennis origin story. (Actually, because the real table tennis table is a bit bigger, to this day, I'm not used to using a real table).

One day, I invited our neighbor's boy to my house. His name is John, and he is a year older than me. We have been good friends since that day. But more importantly: his table tennis is great. Every weekend , we will spend at least two hours a day playing table tennis. In his school, John also plays table tennis, but his classmates can play well. So the two of us are each other's strongest opponents.

We are like yin and yang. He's left-handed, I'm right-handed. He spins the ball, I smash. His ping pong bat is bumpy, mine is smooth. Years of learning from each other (after the age of sixteen, both of us are so busy that we don't have a lot of time to play table tennis). Every time our game is almost evenly divided. So let's continue each time -- next time, who will win? Who is going to win?

Now, John lives in the UK and I live in the US. He is also the strongest ping pong opponent I have ever met. Now, I only have one dream. I hope I can practice my ping pong in Taiwan. After I met John, I will win!

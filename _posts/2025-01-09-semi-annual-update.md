It is that time of year! Some people send Christmas cards, I send this blog post :D.

In 2024, I wrapped up teaching in Taiwan, and said goodbye to all my friends there in May. Then, I went backpacking through Southeast Asia for about five months. Eventually, at the end of October I flew to California, stayed for a couple weeks in the Bay Area, and then onto my parents' home in Florida where I've been for a couple months.

I have a newly designed website! Let me know if you have parts you like or suggestions for improvements.

**Leaving Taiwan & Backpacking**

Backpacking for five months was no joke. It was a good growth experience, and a good way of understanding myself -- consider it a very active form of therapy.

Here are some posts about...
- [Kindness on April 23rd, 2024](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-04-kindness-on-april-23rd-2024/). In my last couple weeks of teaching, I wrote in appreciation of all the kind people I have known in Taiwan. "Some downbeats last a lifetime." -- Ben Goldberg
- Joining a [Rainbow Gathering](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-04-taiwan-rainbow-gathering-2024/) in Taiwan with hippies in the woods
- Visiting [Hong Kong](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-05-homg-kong/), [Auroville](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-05-auroville/) (an intentional community in South India), [traveling independently in India](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-06-indian-independence/)
- Speaking to [people in China](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-07-one-month-in-china/). I stayed there for five weeks in total, traveling with various friends from California and also solo.
- I also traveled in Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam with my good buddy Dean for about two months. Much of this time was focused on internal change and observation. Dean wrote [a great reflection](https://open.substack.com/pub/urbananimal/p/the-philosophy-paper-that-haunted?r=b6zju&utm_medium=ios) about what he learned.
- [Lessons from Travel](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-11-lessons-from-travel/). A good post about all that I learned.

**Moving Back**

It was strange moving back... kind of like being an astronaut in outer space, and crash landing back on earth. When I first came back, it was jarring to see other human beings and feel the force of gravity. My body has slightly adjusted.
- A post about being [fresh off the boat](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-11-reverse-culture-shock/)
- Readjusting [the way people talk](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-11-speaking-plainly/) in California
- [The morning after](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-11-the-morning-after/) the 2024 presidential election

**Settling in**

I've been in the US about two months since coming back. At some point I realized I ought to start looking for work. This task loomed over my head while traveling, but I honestly wasn't in the head space to start networking or sending applications out while on overnight buses in Vietnam. Anyway, life is long, and I think it's okay to take things slowly.

It's a strange thing to think about work while the nature of work is changing so rapidly. I've been startled by generative AI, so I wrote a blog post consolidating [my thoughts](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2025/2025-01-the-future-of-work/) on how life will change in the next few years.

Job hunting for me has three major challenges:
- Discovering what I want to pursue. I've made progress on this (see [Tangible and Intangible Progress](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2025/2025-01-tangible-and-intangible-progress/))
- Pursuing it with maximum efficiency. I haven't done this yet, but I read a good book about it (see [Bible-pusher Rohan](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2024/2024-12-stickers-hope-and-change-and-bible/)). The rate of change of the rate of change is positive.
- Keeping spirits up during the process. Sarasota, Florida has a fantastic ping pong club which I've been attending regularly (see [Miro's Ping Pong Advice](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2025/2025-01-miros-ping-pong-advice/)). I also have been playing saxophone, designing this website, and hanging out with my dear parents.

That's all for now! May you be well, joyful, and kind.

Rohan

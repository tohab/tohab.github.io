title: I've lost my faith in numbers
---

When I was little, I used to love playing with numbers. I’d try
the New York Times Sudoku puzzles with my mom. I would hone my skills in
arithmetic in games online and then zoom through the “minute
multiplication” in school, loving the competition of it. I even learned a
trick to calculate the day of the week of any date, past, present, or
future, inspired by a TED talk I watched. Every bit of math and
numerical manipulation enthralled me.  

  

There is something intoxicating about studying mathematics. It
follows the rhyme and reason not of Shakespeare, but of propositional
logic; the only thing you need to do to “prove” something is write a few
statements that indicate it is so. Those nasty word problems involving
lots of algebra seem impossible at first, but after a moment of
realization it’s clear that all that’s needed to solve them is to write
an equation in a special way. The harder the problem, the more
complicated the equation – this is a trend that follows some for years
beyond high school.  

  

In a certain way it seems ridiculous. But I have always believed in
numbers. I have always trusted data, so long as there’s a lot of it. And
this is a conviction that is widespread in many fields – that the best
way to solve climate change is to “engineer” a solution, that the best
way to solve inequality is a more progressive wealth tax, that the best
way to stop disease is to model it with differential equations. Such a
belief, again, is intoxicating. It turns the big, bad, messy world into
an easy model. The unspoken assumption in economics, science,
engineering, is that there’s a solution if you simply level up the
mathematics – that with sufficiently detailed equations, you can
describe our society.  

  

It was shocking to me to realize that this is not how the world
works. I realized that despite the hundreds of millions of people
trapped in poverty – a number so big it should shock any numerate person
– no one really cares. I realized that despite the certainty that the
world is *dying* – through hundreds of scientifically proven
statements – the political forces are simply not there. And I realized
that despite the *billions* of non-human beings we murder, ruthlessly, every year… No one wants to talk about animal rights.  

  

Why is this? Why are we as human beings so unwilling to accept facts
right in front of us? Why do we cling to what is known instead of what
the data says?  

I feel what is lacking in raw numbers is a *story*. Truly, a
story. Stories last for thousands of years – myths and legends from
ancient India, China, Greece… anywhere have been passed down through
generations. I remember when I was little, too, I would beg my mom to
continue reading Enid Blyton’s *The Five Find-outers* as she sat by my bedside. I would be entranced by the mythological world of Percy Jackson, and by the magic of *Eragon* and *Guardians of Ga’Hoole*.  

  

These stories, statistics, have *no basis* in reality. They
probably don’t even follow the laws of physics. And yet I was, am, and
will always be transfixed by stories. And I think others are too. Barack
Obama’s speech in 2004, simply telling the *story* of his family coming to America, is known as the one that made him president. Upton Sinclair’s *The Jungle*
shed light on the horrific meat-packing industry in a way that labor
statistics never could, thus bringing about massive legislative changes
in the meat-packing industry. And of course, the story of Rosa Parks in
the Civil Rights Movement – not the countless facts about discrimination
in America – is what sparked a wave of resistance across the South.  

  

There’s no science to story-telling. However much I may long for it,
no equation can predict which stories will cut to the hearts of people.
No computer (not yet) can write a *real* story – one with characters you fall in love with, one that shakes you at the core.
Thus the story-teller gains an extraordinary power. When I find time to read a novel (recently, Khaled Hosseini’s *A Thousand Splendid Suns*) I remember the magic it takes.  

  

I’ve always been told numbers – big data, statistics, economics – are
the way to land a job and change the world. I think now that to really
make people *care*, it’s really important to nourish the art of story-telling. There’s really nothing like it.

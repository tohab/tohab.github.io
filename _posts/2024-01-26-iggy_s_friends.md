Yeah, I've become really good friends with Iggy's sister. But it's weird.

Why's it weird? Are you dating?

No. It's just weird because Iggy's dead. 

Iggy's friends are just really nice. If I died and you came and met my friends, you'd find out they're all dick heads. That's just the truth. But Iggy's friends are good people. 


And this guy Oscar, you played basketball with him and Iggy that one time. I thought he was more reserved and I'm more out-going, you know, so we never really got on. But since Iggy passed, I don't know, we've been hanging out a bunch, talked till 3am one time. About Iggy and other things. That's the thing, you know. You only need one thing in common to become friends. 

Me and his mates, we organized a football match for him. There was like a hundred people, playing and watching. Some people met me there and they said, "you're John, aren't you??" They were like so excited to meet me because Iggy had talked about me. And they knew about my life actually, just because of what Iggy had said. And that made me happy.

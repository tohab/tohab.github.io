title: Introducing footnotes
---

I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace. In fact, his piece *Consider the Lobster* is what first introduced me to the cause of animal rights[^potchatek]. Wallace uses a lot of footnotes, and I think I will too, given the option. So I just created this footnote feature, which I think is pretty cool.

Also, here's a nested footnote example for stress-testing[^nested-outer].

[^potchatek]: Kudos to Mr. Potchatek, who assigned that as reading in his "creative non-fiction" class.

[^nested-outer]: The first note can itself cite a friend[^nested-inner].
[^nested-inner]: This is the nested note, waving hello. We'll make sure it renders, too.

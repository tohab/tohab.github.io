title: Introducing footnotes
---

I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace. In fact, his piece *Consider the Lobster* is what first introduced me to the cause of animal rights[^potchatek]. Wallace uses a lot of footnotes, and I think I will too, given the option. So I just created this footnote feature, which I think is pretty cool.

[^potchatek]: Kudos to Mr. Potchatek, who assigned that as reading in his "creative non-fiction" class.

pitter patter on the roof 
"ssssss" goes the kettle 
*click* when it's ready

"how many sugar cubes?"  
my mom calls

plopped in the white mug  
with the Tamil alphabet  
'neath the pink sky
dotted with clouds  
atop the double decker  
chugging down Willesden Lane

easy on the eyes with a dash of milk  
my palm pressed against it for warmth  
and i rest on the cushy red couch  
scalding hot on my lips

too hot to drink!  
then i blow a soft exhale  
o'er the cup  
of tetley british blend.

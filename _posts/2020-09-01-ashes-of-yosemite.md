*This was originally posted on blogger.*
*Whose ashes are these**Which coat the weary mountain?**Whose rage is this**To rain fire from skies above?* *We open our eyes to Yosemite**A valley I know is tranquil**Yet beyond the mountains**I see the flames. The pain**Of those who lie within our wake**Along the ashes of Yosemite.*

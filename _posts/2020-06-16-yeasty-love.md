Shall I compare thee  

To a mush-a-room?  

Whose earthy presence  

Roasts deliciously.   

  

Rich in vitamin  

And in heart  

Your strength to grow   

When we're apart.  

  

You grew on me,  

And the tomatoes in the fridge,  

Slow at first but suddenly  

My fridge was full of you.  

  

At times you have me truffled  

With a magic sort of trance  

I turn to spirituality   

As you make me want to dance.  

  

Deep in earth you may bring light  

[To Mario](https://wwwdabblebabble.wordpress.com/2020/06/12/how-low-can-you-go/), you bring sensation  

To me you bring scrumptiousness   

In one bulbous creation.

The tension between the narly and the beautiful in
jazz. How do you approach it?

 

In music there is a
constant struggle. Struggle to learn your instrument, struggle to transcribe,
struggle to keep up, struggle in your ensemble. Struggle as a verb, an abstract
action. Struggle for expression, justice, freedom as a political idea. Musicians
approach this in a variety of ways -- pop songs may smooth over the struggle,
except for moments when the singer's voice cracks and they say how they really
feel. Steve Lacy, the Bite is a constant struggle; it shows what is behind the
beautiful sounds that we sometimes hear in music.

What draws you to Steve Lacy?

 

In the album with
The Bite, Lacy was experimenting with "extended techniques", ideas;
hence his somewhat harsh, overbiting. In 1979 or so, I was in Berkeley at
Rasputin music carrying around my soprano saxophone. The man at the till said,
"You play soprano sax? Steve Lacy was just here! You have to listen to
this." and I bought the album Evidence (1962). The sound. It's incredible.
It's so hard to do that on soprano saxophone. For 10 or 15 years I worked to
emulate Steve Lacy's sound on the soprano; I transcribed the entire album. I
wasn't able to do it, but the process of struggle made me the player I am
today. I tried for years to play like Steve Lacy and now I play like Ben
Goldberg.

How do you find your people?

At your age, it's
easy. I used to ask people if we could study together. That's how one album of
mine came together -- it was because I felt embarrassed at jam sessions not
knowing all the charts, and I told a guitarist I wanted to study all the songs
we did know. It turned into an album of funked up bebop songs that started with
a central purpose: to study. To study is to do more than "play"
together; it's to strive for betterment and progress on the instrument. The
other tip of finding your people is to be polite.

And, you can study
with other artists. What does it mean to create something with a painter? A
cartoonist? A poet? An actor? What piece of music would come from looking at a
painting? What painting would come from a piece of music? Wisdom and exchange
of ideas in art transcends the particular craft.

 

Others chimed in…

What if you played
music throughout your day. Someone Finn knew had a 30bpm metronome running for
his entire day; and every time it beeped, he would do something rhythmic or
musical. The purpose was to internalize the pulse. Music can be like that. Your
every waking, and sleeping moment can be musical if you make it. Why is there a
dichotomy between making music and living life normally?

 

Recording is important.

It's essential.
Record as much as you possibly can. Every recording carries a memory; a story;
an accident of people getting together to create music.

title: Lessons from Travel
---

\*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://www.rohanprasad.org/2024/11/lessons-from-travel.html)\*.

* **See many perspectives.** While traveling I met a young Israeli sniper on the beaches of Siargao, Chinese nationalists who argue passionately in defense of the Chinese system, conservative French people who hate social welfare but also use it to travel. Keeping cool, curious, and empathetic is hard when you have different beliefs to someone.
* **Overcome social anxiety.** So often when traveling, asking the nearest person is the best way to get the most accurate information. It's essentially a necessity to be bold enough to do this. I think I'm relatively good at doing this but I still have reluctance sometimes that doesn't serve me. Talking to a stranger is a subclass of "jumping into cold water" -- doing something you know has to be done, but you dread and keep procrastinating. I can think of many things that induce a similar feeling: quitting a job, packing up your things, breaking up with someone.
* **See different societies and how they differ.** Even between Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, there were vastly different languages and governmental systems. I learned about Laotian government incompetence; Vietnamese national pride (so many communist flags!); and the laissez-faire Thai labor economy.
* **Learn what is essential to carry.** My friend Dean brought a yoga block (like a styrofoam brick) that he used for meditation and sitting when the ground is uncomfortable. Surprisingly useful! I brought ziploc bags with me to label my things. And a nail clipper. Know thyself.
* **How to make choices with little information.** This is so crucial. So crucial. Where is this bus going? Should I trust this tuk-tuk driver to take me to the ferry port? Why is there a "terminal fee" when I've already bought a boat ticket? Will my bag be overweight or just right? Is this vegetarian soup also vegan? So many cases of not knowing the full story -- having to go by someone's word and just laughing along. On the internet and in America we live in a high-information environment. You can look up anything. It is much harder to look up specifics of traveling in certain places abroad (especially in China -- that's like a whole other universe). So we rely on incomplete information. We pray to the travel gods when we have done all we can. We know that things will be okay so long as you have your passport and wallet and your life.
* **How to be kind to people under duress.** Lack of sleep, 14-hour bus journeys, decision fatigue, tired of looking up vegan food. But then it's always better to be nice to the next person you cross paths with. Patience under fire.
* **How to stay calm.** Deep, slow belly breaths. There's a book about it.
* **How to get information from people, and know what information sources to trust.** Asking people where they recommend to go in a city. Deducing their vibe, thinking about whether you'll like what they like. Chumming up with people, appreciating them when they help you out. Knowing people's love languages -- though most of what I give is kind words and hostel fees. Much more art than science.
* **Make plans that are specific but also flexible.** I realized early on that having a hostel booked for at least one night is a good bet. Otherwise, remain flexible!
* **Adjust plans when necessary.**
* **Be in touch with your feelings about physical environments and people.** Recognizing when you're not vibing with a place and want to move on. Recognizing when the crew you're with is not your crew, and you should kindly excuse yourself.
* **Communicate without a shared language.** Smiles. Pointing. Gesturing. Extensive Google Translate.
* **Express gratitude.** Traveling with just ten kilograms on your back, gratitude is often all you can give.
* **Self-advocate, ask for what you need.** Even when someone's paid to help you, like a hostel front desk staff, asking for something you need is difficult. And it is tiresome to always be reliant on someone else -- but, well, that's life. I hope one day I can pay this forward, and help others who rely on me.
* **Appreciate where you're at.** We travel the external world to explore our inner worlds. The most beautiful places can be so difficult if you're not feeling it. Conversely, the raunchiest places can be hilarious and beautiful if you are appreciating it.
* **Mental endurance, persistence.** All the things I mentioned above are harder when it's month 3 or 4 of traveling.
* **The courage to go against the grain.** When I was traveling, I had just one good friend, Dean, who was doing so at the same time. Long-term backpacking is not something most people do. The tenacity and courage it takes to do it is substantial. It also takes courage, I say to myself, to not have a job lined up, and hope that things will work out in the end.
* **Make trade-offs: money, comfort, time, safety.** Decisions, decisions. So many of them while traveling. No routines, only moving forward. Exhausting!
* **How to kill time/wait when you need to.** Talking to people. Reading my Kindle. Podcasts.
* **Ground yourself in a new physical environment.** (e.g. via routine, exercise, putting luggage in a certain way). No routines but mini-routines. I had my bags set up so they felt familiar. A place for everything, and everything in its place, my dad likes to say. In the same vein, mini-routines in the morning, or a set time to go foraging for food, or having a hot beverage.
* **Accepting there will be mistakes.** In Hong Kong, I thought it was way too pricey and bought too many groceries. I lost my hat and never went back to look for it. I got overcharged for a train booking. Mistakes are human, and I am human. It is part of life to make missteps, and these missteps do not define you. That's a tough lesson.

Imagine there is a crisis on the planet Krypton. It's hard for humans to understand exactly what went wrong -- something to do with partial derivatives, bush-funds, and the inter-galactic financial markets. Either way, the people of Krypton are in deep trouble, and after a meeting of the Council of the Olders, there's only one way out: the human blood trade.

Those on Krypton send big fishing ships to Earth, lowering long cables to pick up humans stranded on the ground. Great care is put to ensure the humane and sustainable capture of those on earth. For instance, if the cables accidentally capture a pregnant women, she is plunged straight back into Earth's orbit so as not to affect the reproduction rate of our species. Those that are captured -- mostly males on the larger size -- are slaughtered via. harmless lethal injections, and their blood is sucked into vats that have the highest possible efficiency rate to prevent waste.

After just 300 hundred years, the harvesting of humans comes to an end. It was the fastest scaling and distribution of human blood in Krypton history. The Krypton economy is once more flourishing, and species conservationists rejoice that humans are still at a sustainable population (some, though, are kept in zoos to prevent complete extinction -- and so that younger generations can know the wonderful creatures that saved Krypton from annihilation).

You may recognize this story as that of the horseshoe crab, a salt water anthropod whose blood is in fact used for a variety of medical remedies for humans, including the COVID-19 vaccine. However wise the Council of Olders, however sustainable the harvesting of humans, and however humane the treatment, most humans would reject the people of Krypton's use (or abuse) of humans. Their decisions -- though logical and self-interested -- are undemocratic and violate the inalienable rights we ought to possess.

The threat of a super-human species exploiting our planet is -- believe it or not -- not just the concern of radical animal rights activists. This very issue animated Elon Musk to develop Neuralink -- an advanced brain machine interface which is, as he describes it, "a Fitbit for your brain." Musk believes that one day, there will come a time where computer intelligence has advanced so much that it exceeds our human capacities. If our treatment of non-human animals illustrates anything, it is that this will go very, very badly for us. The Neuralink devices, however repulsive, is one possible way that we merge with super-human intelligence and hold it accountable to our rights and interests.

Here's another super-human specimen: Google. Facebook. PG&E, McDonald's, or Nestle. The corporation is in a way a cybernetic organism -- a collection of humans that do hundreds or millions of things at once, has enormous amounts of capital, and can lobby their way into government. Moreover, corporations can't be put into jail (only fined) even if they do violence upon the world.

I want to explore some questions in this blog-post, but to do so I need a few friendos: Monkeys, Sapiens, Corpus, Nation State, and the Terminator. These fine beings exist in the universe, whether we like it or not, and we need to find some way to make them get along. The problem is that they're each pretty selfish -- not unlike a monkey wanting their back scratched -- and when they want something, they do pretty nasty things to make it happen.

This is the extended Great Chain of Being and the shenanigans therein.

The characters

Note living beings, legal fictions, information. Note the good and the bad (like B-corps, benevolent dictators)


The cyborgs

Democracy and Dictatorship

Note the mechanisms, like factory farming, business incentives, addictive social media.

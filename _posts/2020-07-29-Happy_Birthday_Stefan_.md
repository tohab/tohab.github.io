There once was a young Homentcovschi,Whose legs were quite long and lanky.    He sure loved the snow    And skied like a proBut off-season Stefan became cranky.
At the old age of twenty,Stefan's joints ached aplenty    So he looked hard at worms    To age on his terms
And lysosomal secrets were found to his glee

Some days Stefan plays bio-engineerOther times he is a fine mountaineer!    A cooker of chille    He's really quite silly,He'll rick-roll you on trumpet for years
On this fine day we'll celebrateHe who's my friend and roommate    In summery July    Thirty upon nighWe honor this Homentcovschi's birth-date.

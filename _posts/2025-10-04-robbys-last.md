title: Robby's Last

I sat with Dada in the basement of Louisa Coffee on Qingnian Road in central Kaohsiung. I was visiting Taiwan and staying for a couple weeks after traveling and going back to America. I've met Dada once before, before she lost her husband to a freak health condition.

Her husband, Robby, who was 36, only a decade older than me. He was cheeriest man I knew; he taught me the ropes of DnD with gusto and played a mean sorcerer in our campaign; he'd lived in Taiwan for almost a decade and loved Dada more than anything else. 

Dada spoke rapidly to me in Mandarin, telling me how he called her in his last moments and she heard the strangled sound of his voice and she hurried home on her scooter and she found him lying there motionless on the ground. And she told me she believes he is still here, and that she sometimes hears his voice in the wind, and I believe her.

title: What I think about when I think about running
---

*This was originally posted on blogger.*
Today, rather predictably, running was the thing that really centered me. I try to run most days, but that doesn't happen unless I'm coerced into it by some third party. The feeling before a run -- a feeling of lethargy and attachment to a present couch -- is one that all runners know. I think the only difference between fast runners and slow runners is that fast runners can get outside, every time.  

  

In engineering or computer science, people often try to find the shortest path between two points. Pure efficiency. In running, however, the goal is really to find the *longest* path to your destination. Pure inefficiency. In fact, most times when I run I do go in a circle\*, which doesn't get me anywhere at all! These days such an idea seems slightly barbaric. But somehow, the act of running -- no matter how painful and inefficient -- brings me a certain joy. I do love that feeling, pressing my feet into the earth, step after step, and slowly making my way to some place ahead. I usually have no destination in mind, and I try to take every detour and passage-way and unexplored street I can possibly find.  

  

Sometimes when I run I look around, seeing the branches and trees and children and dogs playing about. It's quite rare on a run that I finish and think "wow, there was absolutely nothing of interest on the 4 miles I jogged." But if I'm honest with myself, I don't pay much attention to my surroundings. I'm usually absorbed in myself, deconstructing something someone said to me, mulling over how I wasn't invited to some exciting event, or occasionally, thinking about what to write in my journal.  

  

Wherever I went, and whatever was on my mind, when my run is over my mind is clear. The stormy clouds part to reveal a summer's day.  

  

\* or rather, a closed path. My multi-variable calculus professor, [Maciej Zworski](https://math.berkeley.edu/~zworski/), would correct me on that.

I, too, use my runs to be as inefficient as possible :)

title: so you want to make a website

*Note from Rohan: This post was made in collaboration with an LLM (ChatGPT 5). I haven't used an AI to write a blog-post before. The reason I did it for this post in particular is because this post is mostly informative, and not a personal writing piece. It's also not something I'm particularly interested in writing myself, but I still want the information to be out there in the world. I write "in collaboration" with a two caveats: I will declare when I used AI to write a post (by default, I don't use LLMs to write), and I do endorse the content of the post.*

If you want to build a personal website and keep it under your control, here's the approach that has worked for me.

### Start with a template you can customize
- I use the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) as the base. I forked it so I could edit files directly in my own repository.
- Working on [GitHub](https://github.com/) gives me full ownership. Every change is tracked, and I can roll forward or back without waiting on a platform update.
- Treat the theme as a starting point. Remove sections you don't need, add layouts you do, and expect to keep adjusting as you learn what the site should do.

### Understand the hosting stack
- The site runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
- ELI5 version: GitHub Pages is the librarian that places your Markdown files on the web for free. Jekyll is the translation engineâ€”it reads those Markdown files, applies the theme, and produces static HTML that loads quickly.
- Once the repository is configured, publishing is as easy as merging a pull request. No servers to monitor.

### Point a custom domain
- I purchased the domain on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). Their dashboard makes DNS updates straightforward.
- After buying the domain, configure the A records and CNAME to point at GitHub Pages. GitHub's documentation walks through the exact values; it takes about 10 minutes the first time.

### Edit locally, not in the browser
- I write and configure everything in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Having the text editor, file tree, and Git tools in one place keeps the workflow simple.
- Keep posts in Markdown and version-control everything. It makes diffs easy to review later.

### Use AI as an accelerator
- I pair program with [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) and [OpenAI's GPT-5](https://openai.com/). When I'm unsure how to change a layout or tweak SCSS, I describe the goal and let the model draft the change.
- The models are good at proposing complete snippets. My job is to review, edit, and commit the parts that make sense.
- A quick story: this summer I broke the navigation and was stuck on 404s for days. Codex produced the fix in one pass. It was a reminder that these tools can unblock you when you hit the edge of your experience.

### Why I recommend this path
- You learn how static sites work while still relying on mature tooling.
- The stack is inexpensive: GitHub Pages is free, Jekyll is open-source, and a domain costs the price of a mediocre dinner once a year.
- Even if you only dig into the code occasionally, the combination of Git history and AI assistance makes changes approachable.

If you're willing to tinker, this setup gives you a durable home for your writing and a hands-on lesson in how the web is put together.

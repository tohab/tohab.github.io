title: Willy Nilly Blogging

*This was originally posted on blogger.*
I was talking to my friend Andrew today and he said he likes my habit of "willy nilly" blogging. That is, not thinking too hard about something before publishing and sharing it with the world.  
[This blog](https://marginalrevolution.com/) is a good example of this. Tyler Cowen literally blogs twice a day. A prolific thought producer, or at least excellent at writing thoughts down (and when thoughts are written down, they turn into ideas).  
I support this but in actuality my blogging is not that willy nilly; I've only blogged every month or two the past year.  
But I just had a spark of inspiration -- what if I could blog from my phone? Then I could blog from the Kaohsiung MRT, a Donutes coffee shop, or Jade Mountain. I'm not surprised to find that there's an app for that. So that's how I'm blogging now.

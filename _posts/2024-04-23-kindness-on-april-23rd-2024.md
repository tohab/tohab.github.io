title: Kindness on April 23rd, 2024
---

*This was originally posted on blogger.*

My old jazz professor Ben Goldberg once wrote, "there are some downbeats that last a lifetime." As I write this it happens to be the eve of my 24th birthday. At midnight it'll be April 24th, 2024, exactly two zodiac cycles after I was born.   
  
Tonight I've felt especially grateful for the kindness of souls in Taiwan. Admittedly I was feeling low about my coming departure a couple days ago. Being amidst a transition and not knowing where I'll exactly end up after is discombobulating. But today Somehow some part of me really grasped the meaning of that Winnie the Pooh quote, "Don't cry that it's over, smile that it happened." When I chose to come to Taiwan, I didn't know at all that leaving would take such emotional strength -- even after two years -- but it has and it will.  
  
Today I taught my wonderful advanced class. We watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, reaching the part where the five golden ticket holders reach the entrance of Willy Wonka's grand enterprise. We played a deception game called Love Letter. They laughed and had fun. One student, Linda, said, "Teacher, my mom wants me to get you something. But I don't know what to get. Do you like coffee or tea?" I smiled, and said I like tea. I reminded the class that if they get me anything not vegan, it goes to Teacher Bryan downstairs. These kids are old enough to know I'm vegan, especially since I've taught them for two years. Then, one girl Yafei asked me if I can pass on a gift to her old teacher, Teacher Kate, who lives in America. I don't know Teacher Kate and I don't know where she lives, but I said I could -- I suppose it's the jobs of teachers to make magic happen. It'll cost a few dollars in shipping and careful packing of my suitcase, but the thought of young Yafei's gift reaching Kate makes it well worth it.

After class I told Teacher Nick I will miss him, and that he's a rather unique person. He's one of the Taiwanese staff at the school who's in charge of the kids when they're not in class. I clapped him on the shoulder and he did not recoil, and I think he smiled, although it was hard to see under his mask. That's a rare thing from Teacher Nick, and it was certainly enough for me. I also told that to Teacher Cathy, who's in charge of getting my supplies and helping students who are falling behind. I told her, "Cathy, we're best friends, but I don't know how to make you happy. Mango juice didn't work, chocolate didn't work. What can be a goodbye gift?" She said, "don't bother me, that makes me happy!" Teacher Nick laughed at that. It's hard to express why, but it's these little moments that make Kaohsiung for me. The directness of people startled me when I got here. But I've come to see it as a down-to-earth, genuine kindness that's unparalleled where I come from.   
  
I walked back with my friend and colleague Teacher Phil. Phil and I do our walk to the MRT every Tuesday and Friday. Generally on these walks we talk about Dungeons and Dragons, students we teach, or what we would do if we were the CEO of Schoolhouse. Today, maybe it settled in that I'm leaving work so soon -- next Friday! He asked about what I'm doing after I leave Kaohsiung. I told him my travel plans. He said, "and then after you said you'll move back to the US right? You'll grow up and get a proper job." It's true that is the intention and he meant it with no judgement. Phil is a rare person who lives life without being in a hurry (The other person I know like this is Bowen the librarian). He told me how he dropped out of university at age 19, fucked around in his twenties bartending, traveling, doing drugs and going to music festival. He only finished his bachelors when he was 30, and a masters a few years later, and now he's doing quite alright for himself and his wife Zoe in Taiwan. I know so many people who clung tight to the railroad tracks that take you from elementary school to university to gainful employment and a house and kids. It's a nice reminder to meet people who's strayed off the beaten path, because of course most people turn out alright. Phil's fantastic at what he does, I think not in spite of, but because of his record of getting shit-faced in his 20s.   
  
Today also as I was buying fruit juice, another customer said hello to me and gave me a couple bananas just because I asked her what fruit juice she liked. Then my old landlord Michael called and told me, of course I can leave my stuff at his place when I'm away, and that I should stay at his house for the few days I return. Again, the random acts of kindness are abound in this city.  
  
My uncle Sampath is walking the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain for about a month. I have to say, it's hard to imagine him, at 60 years old!, staying in hostels and walking with a bike pack for so long. Great kudos for getting out of his comfortable retired life in California. His audaciousness inspires me, and his [amusing blog](https://samcamino.wordpress.com/) reminds me that traveling can't be all that bad. I'll be sure to blog once or twice a week while on the road as a way to keep in touch with friends and myself.

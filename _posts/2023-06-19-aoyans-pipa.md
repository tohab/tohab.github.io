title: Aoyan's Pipa
---
I met a man named Aoyan today playing the *pipa*, a Chinese instrument. It's like a guitar, but has a bustier bottom, and has a fabulous sound -- the sound of rain drops and a mountain-side view. It reminds me of those old Chinese landscape paintings, the ones where there are people walking along a bridge carrying water for the village, and people dressed up riding horses and the mountains in the background. All from four strings and a block of wood.

Aoyan tells me the *pipa's* ancestor is the *lute*. The design was passed Eastward and, according to Aoyan, is the origin of similar instruments like the Middle Eastern *oud* and the Indian *sitar*.   


Aoyan goes through a variety of techniques on the *pipa*. The sound of raindrops, that's a technique. And so is the heavy vibrato that's as vibrant as an electric guitar. One can even cross strings on the *pipa*, and when strum together it gives a terrific crash.

Some *pipa* from the Qing and Ming dynasties have been preserved, Aoyan tells me. He saw some masters playing them at an academy in Taipei. But you can also buy them on *Taobao* for a few hundreds US dollars. *You seem like you're interested in learning instruments*, Aoyan says to me. It's true that I am. Having just started learning guitar, I'm realizing the vastness of what you can do with four metal strings.

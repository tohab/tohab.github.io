This is a letter I wrote to my economics professor about what
 we are taught in university. The main idea, I suppose, is that we 
should not only ask “what is efficient?” but also, “what is right?”.



Dear Professor _____



I hope you are well! I wanted to address my comment in Monday’s class
 – “why study the Welfare theorems if they are based on such ‘stupid’ 
premises?” – because I fear it was taken the wrong way. But first, I am 
sorry for my sass and any disturbance it caused, and I appreciated your 
thoughtful answer despite that. I meant to explain further, and so I 
hope to visit your office hours next week. Regardless, I wrote down some
 of my thoughts so we could be on the same page.



I agree that the Welfare Theorems and other important results in 
classical economics are beautiful and profound. Some of the results of 
respected economists are indeed miraculous, and it is an honor to study 
such subjects from esteemed professors such as yourself.



It seems to us students, however, that these beautiful theorems are 
seem unrelated to our actual world. You made the point that in physics, 
we first study the frictionless, idealized case before moving onto 
complications. This is all very well for physicists. But economics is 
about people, not particles, and living beings cannot simply be reduced 
to mathematical equations. Moreover, making these erroneous assumptions 
while ignoring the suffering caused can have massive consequences in our
 world.



An example is in the recent problem set, where Question 3 was about 
“perfect competition”, set in a “mango farm” in the Philippines. If one 
researches a little into the plight of Filipinx farmers and 
international corporations, this sentence suddenly seems massively 
inappropriate. It’s well-known that farmers there face dangerous 
chemicals, long hours, and exploitative conditions, all of which was 
ignored in your problem set.



One example is an article by a Filipino journalist about the plight 
of rice farmers in his country. He writes, “there was a time when 
[farming and agriculture] boosted the economy and put us on the map… 
today, our rice farming industry is up against the ropes and our own 
government… how can we pay people less and still expect them to 
survive?” Nevertheless, the very theorems that you tote in class are the
 ones that companies use to justify exploitation of workers around the 
globe.

The continued obsession with “rational consumers”, the “free” market,
 and other neo-liberal assumptions has had horrible consequences on 
nations in the past. An example of this is the actions of the World Bank
 in Jamaica, where the imposition of the Structural Adjustment Loan 
Project caused an unnecessary reduction in public safety nets and social
 support, massively harming poor people in a formerly-colonized nation. 
Fatmir Haskaj referenced an exhaustive article about this in his 
Berkeley class on global poverty.



Finally, an obsession with the “free” market is an insult to the 
planet and non-human life on our earth. The same economists who 
theorized about Pareto efficiency have been the creators of industrial 
capitalism, the force that is destroying our planet. British journalist 
George Monbiot has an excellent piece on the evils of this exploitative 
system:

But even despite all this, I really love economics. I love playing 
with equations, optimizing variables, and thinking about our world 
through this lens. I also find it equally important to consider the 
social ramifications of what economists are saying. We should not just 
ask “what is efficient”, but also “what is right? “



Economics could have
 so much to say about the environment, human and animal rights, and 
other social justice issues of our time. It is my hope that your class 
can cover those topics – not as a side-tangent, but as a serious issue –
 so that students can emerge the class with tools to make the world a 
better place.



Most sincerely,

The last time I was on a plane was in March. Back then the world is
in chaos, and now it still is. The Coronavirus was looming. My
university had just been closed for the rest of the semester.
California was about to enter an emergency lockdown, as if there were
some terrorist threat. Presidents, Chancellors, and Prime Ministers
were on TV, throwing about words like “global pandemic” “public
health crisis” “social distancing.” I didn’t know what would
happen – would I even be able to board my flight? Would police
shoot anyone walking on the streets? How long would this thing last?
In that terror I walked onto a largely empty plane, masked up and
wary of what was to come.



	Now I’m back on board United Airlines. The uncertainty that
permeated the air five months ago has mostly calloused into a bleak
outlook for the next few months, especially in the United States.
Millions have lost their jobs, hundreds of thousands have lost their
lives, and countless industries are scarred by this nuisance of a
virus. Then there’s my comparatively small disappointment: the
University of California, Berkeley has canceled in-person classes.
There won’t be anyone hurrying from class to class on campus –
there won’t even be many students in Berkeley – for all of this
semester and possibly through the following Spring.



	The Coronavirus is an invisible demon… but I suppose those are the
worst types. You can’t see it, but you can see the havoc it reigns
upon us: scarred lungs, high temperatures, and a death threat.
Somehow one strand of RNA has uprooted the lives of every human
on earth – how is that even
possible?? I’m not sure
I’ll ever get over it.



 The
world is a bizarre place, in
all honesty. Despite online
classes I’m still going to Berkeley to study. And
I’m going there by flying
in a humongous
hunk of metal with wings.
When I stop to think about
it, it’s
miraculous that I’m even
breathing thousands of feet
off the ground. 




 In
some sense the Coronavirus
has made us reckon with our old selves. Our
world is bizarre and I
ought to count my blessings that I live here, not
anywhere else. Think
about the creators
(spiritual
or mechanical, whichever
you like) who invented
things like flying machines, automated vehicles, and
a world-wide web of information… They
must’ve been so proud, and
imagined how happy people would be after their
invention was widely distributed. What
would they say to lol cats,
COVID
trips to Hawaii or Formula One?





 Nevertheless
the world changes fast. A
year ago if I read this very essay, I wouldn’t
at all believe it (oh,
such an innocent time. Is there
some
way to go back?). In other
ways, I guess the world
doesn’t really change at all. Throughout
our history there’s always
been the “arrogance of man” as
well as natural disasters to
put us in our place. There’s
always been selfish
people who make things worse,
and good people
who try to make things
better. I guess this
is another one of those situations.



 I,
and I’m sure many others, wish
they had behaved differently before COVID-19… but
I mean, this is the situation
and it’s all we’ve got.
Maybe if I resign myself to
this, I’ll be liberated
from the thoughts of “what
if… what if...” One day I
know the world will
return to normal, but until
then I think I’ll
enjoy life as best I can.

For a more reflective, experiential perspective, see my other post, “The Abyss of Job Searching.”</em></p> <p>What are the three things you can give someone who’s job searching?</p> <ul> <li>Information. For example, how to job search well, or knowledge about your industry.</li> <li>Confidence. Encouragement, love and support.</li> <li>Connections. An introduction to someone you know.</li> </ul> <p>This blog post aims to share the first category of thing: information.</p> <h3 id="stage-1-explore-what-you-want-to-do">Stage 1: Explore what you want to do.</h3> <ul> <li>Let’s break “what do you want to do?” down into three sub-questions: <ul> <li>What role?</li> <li>What industry?</li> <li>What location?</li> </ul> </li> <li>I’m not saying these questions are easy to answer, but at least you know what you’re looking for.</li> <li>These decisions will require you to be both introspective and opportunistic. Generally, you must learn where what you are good at / interested in intersects with a market need. <ul> <li>Interviewing many others to learn what they do</li> <li>Doing self-assessments and reflections to consider what you’re good at</li> <li>Surveying the market and considering what’s in-demand (skills, industries, types of organizations).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Once you’ve answered these questions, you can give a mission statement. For example: <ul> <li>“I’m looking for product management roles at AI startups in the Bay Area.”</li> <li>“I want to do customer success remotely for an ed-tech company.”</li> <li>“I’m targetting operations roles at climate tech companies.”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Having trouble? Here are some thoughts: <ul> <li>Have more conversations. Trust your gut.</li> <li>Choose a couple roles or industries to start with. You may narrow down later as you continue to learn about these fields.</li> <li>Just pick something! No one has information, and there is no right answer. By picking something, you’ll learn about yourself and can recalibrate the next time you look for a job.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Notes: on mission statements <ul> <li>Some “mission statements” will be more attainable than others. This depends on your background, the field you choose, and the job market in your target location.</li> <li>It helps to know your priorities. If your goal is to move countries, switch fields or do something where there are fewer jobs, by all means – go ahead! It will be hard, but honestly, this process will be hard any way you look at it.</li> <li>My mission statement, for both pragmatic reasons and personal assessment: operations/sales jobs at AI startups</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><em>My 2025 search experience: I did about 8 informational interviews before I had any idea of what job I was targeting. From that point, I still had questions so kept clarifying my career direction with every subsequent conversation.</em></p> <h3 id="stage-2-create-a-narrative">Stage 2: Create a narrative.</h3> <ul> <li>The Tell Me About Yourself question (TMAY) is the most critical thing I’ve found to nail in the job search process. The function of TMAY is: <ul> <li>To humanize you. What’s your story?</li> <li>To define your value proposition (i.e., make the case that you’re the perfect person for the job).</li> </ul> </li> <li>I got this advice later on in my job search: build a portfolio. This came from a frank but jarring conversation with someone well-connected at a venture capital firm. He said, “I can’t recommend passing on your CV just because you’re a nice guy and went to Berkeley. That’s a bad look. You have to have demonstrated skills.” So the three things recommended for this are: <ul> <li>Good hustling. Hustling (see next step) is 1000x better than sending in cold applications. <em>Particularly</em> if you are pivoting in roles, industries, or locations (I’m doing all three).</li> <li>Good branding. 10x better than good hustling. This means having a portfolio, like some document that has a display of your notable past work and how you thought about each step.</li> <li>A halo project. 10x better than good branding. If you’re a salesperson, schedule a meeting for the company before you’re hired. If you’re a product manager, critique their product and recommend solutions. If you’re a UX designer, rebuild their website using Figma. This method is not scalable, since each halo project takes time. But just like hustling and good branding, it sets you apart. So few people do it—if you build something good and relevant for a company, it’s bound to get the attention of any CEO you email.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><em>Throughout my process, I:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Practiced my tell me about yourself extensively</em></li> <li><em>Made a <a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/work/">work portfolio</a> that documents my past accomplishments</em></li> <li><em>I never got to doing the halo project, but I did build a demo for a startup (Wordware) after an initial interview. That was cool and they found it impressive!</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="stage-3-network">Stage 3: Network.</h3> <ul> <li>Networking essentially means having 20-minute professional conversations with as many people as possible. The goal is to build rapport.</li> <li>With rapport, you may gain access to a contact’s connections and influence. Contacts can help advance your job search in three main ways: <ul> <li>Information. They can teach you to speak the language of the industry/role. If you’re early on in the job search, they can probably tell you things you don’t know. If you’re later on, you can still ask for information as a way to build rapport.</li> <li>Connections. If they’re well-connected within their organization or know many people, they can pass you on. For instance, venture capital folk will know tons of startup founders. An engineer at a big company may help you, or they may not.</li> <li>Influence. If they’re in the position to directly hire, they’re a great person to talk to. Or, if the hiring manager is busy, getting connected with their friend could lead to a warm introduction, and you’d stand out in the crowd.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How do you meet people? This is the meat of networking, and networking is the meat of job searching. I found four ways effective: <ul> <li>Cold emails. Find someone on LinkedIn, get their email, and send them a short email asking to talk. Follow Dalton’s 6-point email for specifics!</li> <li>Go to events. Conferences, parties, one-offs on Eventbrite—whatever! At events, you can meet people, get the contacts of anyone who may be relevant/useful, and ping them later for a 20-minute phone call. Since they’ve met you in person, they’ll be much more useful than cold emailing. You should remember that not everyone will be well-connected or in a position to hire, so the hit rate is not 100%. <ul> <li><em>Tip: Michelle Fang’s <a href="https://www.startertosf.guide/michellesnotion/starter-guide-to-sf-for-founders-ad0e4f3702b04d339599638ef1afb416">Starter Guide to SF</a> lists tons of events and event aggregators in the SF Bay Area.</em></li> </ul> </li> <li>Communities. Joining a Slack community for a particular field or a professional association will make people more likely to respond to a cold message. I got introductions and numerous helpful advisors this way. <ul> <li><em>Tip: Ask ChatGPT, “what are good online communities I can join in X field” (e.g., East Bay climate tech, remote product managers, environmental nonprofits)</em></li> </ul> </li> <li>Warm introductions. You may be lucky enough that a family friend, old college classmate etc. knows someone who’s hiring. You can start with a 20-minute catch-up call, then ask if they know anyone else to chat with. They may not, if they’re not well-connected—don’t take it personally. If someone you do speak with passes you along to someone else, <em>follow up</em> and ask for an innocent informational chat!</li> </ul> </li> <li>What does the conversation look like? <ul> <li>Read Steve Dalton’s <em>The 2-Hour Job Search</em>! He describes the TIARA technique (trends, insights, advice, resources, assignments)</li> <li>In brief, you should ask questions about their work and keep the interviewee talking. Your goal is for them to consider you a mentee, so they provide sustained guidance throughout your job search.</li> <li>As you’re closing, you may ask, “do you know anyone else I should chat with who may be useful?”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Note: Stay the course! <ul> <li>Networking is the strongest, evidence-backed way to find a job. Stay the course! When in doubt, re-read the 2-hour Job Search! People tell you to send cold applications to the void. Of course, some jobs are gotten that way, but those are the exceptions. Know that these people are not career coaches or job searching experts, and don’t know what they’re talking about!</li> <li>Some people are downers to talk to. Don’t let them get to you! By nature of being a “search”, you never know how close you are to finding a job until it’s right in front of you. Continue having conversations at a reasonable, sustainable pace.</li> <li>Be confident. Take breaks. Pursue fun things on the side. You cannot typically grind out networking in one week, so do it in parralel with things that make you happy.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><em>In my job search, I:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Sent 100+ cold emails, with 10–15 resulting informational interviews</em></li> <li><em>Went to 2 conferences (Effective Altruism Global and AI for Animals) where I had ~30 one-on-one meetings</em></li> <li><em>Attended about 5 networking events</em></li> <li><em>Sent &lt;10 cold applications (I spent this time cold emailing!)</em></li> <li><em>Sent about 4 warm applications</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="stage-4-interview">Stage 4: Interview.</h3> <ul> <li>Congrats if you get to an interview! Interviews can be sporadic, nerve-racking, and unnatural. Luckily, I learned from Dalton’s <em>The Job Closer</em> (the companion to <em>The 2-Hour Job Search</em>) that you can prepare quite well.</li> <li>The key question: Tell me about yourself (TMAY) <ul> <li>This deserves a lot of practice.</li> <li>It’s the most important question because it’s the first asked. Some ridiculous proportion of interviews are decided in the first three minutes of an interaction.</li> <li>I included 3 main experiences in my TMAY. These were: economics research or Beyond Meat (depending on the role), co-founding Grassyouths, and teaching English in Taiwan.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Three other core questions: <ul> <li>Why this industry? Why this organization? And why this role?</li> <li>If you can ace these four questions, you’ve got 80% of the value out of interview prep.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The remaining 20% may come from situational questions. “Tell me about a time when you…” (dealt with conflict, managed competing priorities, dealt with customers, had to take initiative) <ul> <li>I recommend having three really great stories, and seven more that you can pull from. This helps in case you’ve been through many interviews and the organization has heard your stories before. If you have 10 stories, you can be pretty certain that one of your examples can fit the situation that’s coming up.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><em>I had 5 initial interviews, most of them with a warm introduction. 4 of those progressed to a second stage interview.</em></p> <h3 id="stage-5-negotiation">Stage 5: Negotiation.</h3> <ul> <li>First of all, some employers or recruiters may ask, “what’s your salary expectation?” This was jarring for me—I was earning something like $15k USD in Taiwan, so it was hard to know what to aim for. <ul> <li>Your answer should be, “Salary is not the most important thing. I’m really focused on finding a company that has the right culture and mission. However, I am considering jobs with salaries ranging from X to Y.”</li> <li>You can use jobs you’re considering to gauge expectations, or your current salary, or jobs you’ve had in the past.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you get a verbal offer, ask to see the details of the offer written out for you. Do not give the first number! Not even if asked directly.</li> <li>Do a Pre-Negotiation Call (PNC) to feel out the company’s flexibility on different aspects of the offer (see Dalton’s <em>The Job Closer</em>).</li> <li>Subsequently, do a negotiation call where you ask for certain improvements on the offer with a “because” after every statement (see Dalton!).</li> </ul> <p><em>In my process, I received two verbal offers. One of which was full of smoke, and I accepted the other (there were also 2 other bad offers that were 100% commission sales gigs—I said I’d rather keep looking).</em></p> <h3 id="timeline">Timeline:</h3> <ul> <li>Oct 30. Landed in America bewildered, startled.</li> <li>mid-Nov. Set the intention to get a job.</li> <li>Nov &amp; Dec. Informational chats with friends and family. I learned a lot about career ladders and phrases.</li> <li>mid-Dec. Started cold outreach emails to employees at target companies.</li> <li>mid-Jan. Had my first informational interview with someone from a cold email. These ended up coming consistently at a 10% rate.</li> <li>Feb 12. Came in-person to the Bay Area. <ul> <li>Feb 14. At a Valentine’s Day party, met someone who heard I was job searching and said, “we’re hiring like crazy!

It’s essentially an official offer. I’m completely blown away!</p> <p>I’m extremely proud of myself. I’ve been hustling so hard. Since December, I’ve sent over a hundred emails, had dozens of coffee chats, went to random conferences and events. It’s a constant process of asking for help, following up. <em>So much follow-up</em>, <em>so much hustle</em>. More hustle than I’ve ever done in my life.</p> <p>I take pride in that. I hustled a little for my past jobs: I sent ~20 emails to get a research position with Rausser and Zilberman. For Beyond, I contacted numerous companies, and ultimately got that through a Berkeley professor. Then with my job in Taiwan, I did network and follow-up and landed the gig through a 5th degree connection.</p> <p>Some lucky folks can get away for several years, perhaps even decades, without truly hustling. They might be comfortable in one large corporation, or attractive enough professionally that recruiters reach out to them. But the rest of us – the fool-hardy, idealistic, or ambitious – gotta hustle. In a weird job market, I was moving countries, changing industries, and essentially a fresh grad trying to break in. It felt like an impossible task.</p> <p>The first mountain to overcome was deciding what I wanted to do. I had no idea. Even after having worked during summers, done economics research, organized political campaigns on-campus… I had no idea what job was for me. Well, I still don’t. But at some point I chose my priorities. The job, ideally, would let me: stay in the Bay Area, have the chance to grow and take on new responsibilities, and let me try on many hats. In life, I have many priorities – making an impact being another major one – but one job can’t do everything. For now, I want to be in the Bay where my friends are, and do things that make sense early career.</p> <p>Then it was a question of what job would fit those requirements. I spoke to a lot of people in November and December and slowly made progress. Folks told me about roles and what they mean: product manager, sales engineer, customer success manager, account manager, operations. I learned that at big companies, your focus can be very narrow, whereas at small companies or startups, you can try on a lot of hats. I also learned at startups that people can have major upward momentum, especially if the company is doing well. So I had some semblance of an answer: operations or sales jobs at tech startups in the Bay. I had a one-liner, the answer to, “what do you want to do?” It was a major step forward.</p> <p>Looking for my first big boy job, I had three main things going for me: hunger, charisma, and a book: <em>The 2-Hour Job Search</em> by Steve Dalton. His book was my bible. He broke down the idea of “networking” and fully understood the user journey. He has a wealth of experience (being a career counselor at Duke’s business school), a concrete way of communicating and a rational, measured approach to decision-making.</p> <p>The book was important to me, because there is <em>so much</em> conflicting information about job searching. There’ll be dozens of resume templates, everyone has different suggestions of what you should do. It is the most frustrating thing ever! I learned quickly that advice is easy to come by and very hard to implement. I recommend the Dalton book, but why should you believe me? All I can say is that having <em>one</em> (and exactly one) go-to source of information that spanned the entire process was invaluable for my peace of mind. I didn’t have to overthink how I phrased an email or how many I sent or to whom, because I had a trusted mentor laying it all out.</p> <p>I had many career chats, but two stick in my mind. My mom’s friend’s son – we’ll call him Dhruv. He’s 32, a product manager at a tech company. He says it’s important to have an intention going into a job. Fight for responsibility and pay. And leave when they’re taking more than you’re taking from them. He’s left and joined an impressive slew of organizations: various interesting start-ups, he worked for peanuts in the film industry, but ultimately realized he wants to save money first and do film later in life as a hobby. His perspective mirrors the excellent <a href="https://www.monbiot.com/career-advice/">career advice essay</a> by British journalist George Monbiot:</p> <blockquote> <p>“When faced with the choice between engaging with reality or engaging with what Erich Fromm calls the “necrophiliac” world of wealth and power, choose life, whatever the apparent costs may be. Your peers might at first look down on you: poor Nina, she’s twenty-six and she still doesn’t own a car. But those who have put wealth and power above life are living in the world of death, in which the living put their tombstones – their framed certificates signifying acceptance to that world – on their walls. Remember that even the editor of the Times, for all his income and prestige, is still a functionary, who must still take orders from his boss. He has less freedom than we do, and being the editor of the Times is as good as it gets.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Another memorable phone call was with Swami (name redacted), a partner at a VC firm. This call was brutal. I came in with my normal informational interview questions – broad, generic, and it was clear I hadn’t done my homework. Swami picked up on my bullshit and said, “Listen, Rohan, I say this lovingly. When you have 15 minutes to talk to a venture capital partner, you better do your goddamn homework.” He then told me what I should’ve done: chosen 3 firms from his portfolio, told him why I’m a great person to work at these companies, and told him why I’m excited by it. I was shocked – how many people have the balls to push back like that in an informational interview? I thought I was leading the conversation! Nevertheless, it was transformative. I told Swami it was my first time looking for a big boy job, and my first time packaging myself. Swami then said, “look, you’re new to the startup world, but you’re not new to branding yourself. You did it to get into Berkeley, you did it to get connected with me. When you have a polished, forwardable email I can send to a startup founder, call me back.” He was charitable and specific in his advice that I couldn’t help but go and do what he was suggesting.</p> <p>That conversation was a phase shift for me. I realized I had to get serious about branding, preparation, and professionalization if I was to succeed. I realized that people are judging me not on my worth as a person, but rather my monetary value to their enterprise. Hiring people is like buying furniture. You want a strong, sturdy item that fits well in your home. The job market is a <em>market</em> for human capital. Goods on a market will only sell if they’re presented in the best light. I therefore needed to network, to have a shtick, a story.</p> <p>Do I enjoy making these horridly objectifying analogies? No, I don’t. I had avoided it thus far because every ounce of me despises “snakey” behavior. Being a snakey networker was, in my mind, was for CEOs, consultants, and tech bros. But I had to recognize the cold reality of the job market. My goal is to have career growth and create an impact in the long-run, and for that, I knew I needed to drink the kool-aid in the short-run. With a different view, I could better create distance between my personal feelings and what needed to get done.</p> <p>Things proceeded pretty quickly! I landed in the Bay mid-February. I went to two major conferences, one of which eventually led to an interview, then another interview, then a work trial, and an on-site marathon interview series, and then finally an offer. But since January, I’ve been “on the job” the whole way through – constant emails, going to events, asking “do you know anyone who might be useful to talk to?”. The one thing that does work out happens pretty fast, but it’s a matter of persisting and not losing hope until that happens.</p> <p>Over the past four months, I approached the study and practice of job searching with the seriousness of an academic. I read the books, dove into the data, interviewed the experts. In something so random and luck-driven, you can really only focus on the process. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs9Tu34Qc-s">Jacket on, jacket off</a>. I’m proud of myself for persevering through it all.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="reflection"/><category term="personal"/><category term="technology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I believe I found a job!!!

He is considered a more safety-oriented AI executive. Anthropic’s strategy has allegedly been to develop “safe”, reliable AI and thereby encourage other firms to follow suit.</p> <p>Most recently, Amodei has gone one step further toward being another Sam Altman. He wrote his blog post <em>On Deepseek and Export Controls</em>, which argues for greater export controls so that the US can be <em>the first and only great power</em> to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). His argument goes like this:</p> <ul> <li>Americans have the best chance of deploying safe AGI.</li> <li>If we get there first, then we can take a “commanding and long-lasting lead on the global stage”</li> <li>Therefore, America must speed up AI development massively and also slow down Chinese AI companies as much as possible.</li> </ul> <p>My main problem with this line of argumentation — what would the Chinese think of this? If I were Xi Jinping, my reasoning would be:</p> <ul> <li>China has the best chance of deploying safe AGI.</li> <li>If we get there first, then we can take a “commanding and long-lasting lead on the global stage”</li> <li>Therefore, China must speed up AI development massively and also slow down American AI companies as much as possible.</li> </ul> <p>Sound familiar? Everyone thinks they’re the good guys. The difference between a national hero and enemy number one is simply who tells the story.</p> <p>The result of <em>both China and the US</em> racing toward AGI is intense <em>race dynamics</em>. This is the worst thing in the world. Because that means any <em>thought</em> of safety is essentially void! Why would you slow down model development when the other country is on your heels or in the lead?</p> <p>It’s as if China and the US are in a boxing match. The more punches they throw at each other, the more the crowd cheers and goes wild. So both parties think that to <em>win</em> you need to knock out the other person. But actually, the way to win is to disengage from the fight completely — because if you don’t, everyone in the stadium dies.</p> <p>Sounds dark? Well, it’s a real possibility. We’re essentially in a game of chicken. The more advanced these models are, the more profit there is to be made off of them. And the more incentive there is to steal model weights, do corporate espionage, and not be left behind. But if the model is so advanced that it creates danger, then we’re all screwed. I wonder if AI extinction is the solution to the Fermi paradox.</p> <p>The solution is <em>not</em> to race as fast as possible to the endgame. The solution is to coordinate to develop and spread the boons of this powerful technology. And to have some major fraction of the human resources and computing power dedicated to “the alignment problem.” Currently, for every dollar spent on alignment, there may be a hundred spent on capabilities. This is driving us very fast off a cliff.</p> <p>The alignment “problem” is fundamental to capitalism. Corporations are highly intelligent, highly resourced cybernetic organisms that have corrupted the government (through money in politics), our psyches (through social media algorithms), and they may soon take over the whole world (through profit-seeking AI models). This must be stopped!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ethics"/><category term="social-change"/><category term="ai"/><category term="technology"/><category term="capitalism"/><category term="politics"/><category term="china"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dario Amodei is the CEO of Anthropic.

Some people send Christmas cards, I send this blog post :D.</p> <p>In 2024, I wrapped up teaching in Taiwan, and said goodbye to all my friends there in May. Then, I went backpacking through Southeast Asia for about five months. Eventually, at the end of October I flew to California, stayed for a couple weeks in the Bay Area, and then onto my parents’ home in Florida where I’ve been for a couple months.</p> <p>I have a newly designed website! Let me know if you have parts you like or suggestions for improvements.</p> <p><strong>Leaving Taiwan &amp; Backpacking</strong></p> <p>Backpacking for five months was no joke.

Much of this time was focused on internal change and observation.

At some point I realized I ought to start looking for work. This task loomed over my head while traveling, but I honestly wasn’t in the head space to start networking or sending applications out while on overnight buses in Vietnam. Anyway, life is long, and I think it’s okay to take things slowly.</p> <p>It’s a strange thing to think about work while the nature of work is changing so rapidly. I’ve been startled by generative AI, so I wrote a blog post consolidating <a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2025/2025-01-the-future-of-work/">my thoughts</a> on how life will change in the next few years.</p> <p>Job hunting for me has three major challenges:</p> <ul> <li>Discovering what I want to pursue. I’ve made progress on this (see <a href="https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2025/2025-01-tangible-and-intangible-progress/">Tangible and Intangible Progress</a>).</li> <li>Pursuing it with maximum efficiency.

The rate of change of the rate of change is positive.</li> <li>Keeping spirits up during the process.

So he really knows how to <em>play</em>. His advice:</p> <p>“Rohan, this sport is all about practice. If you practice, you will get better, whether you like it or not. Practice. Play with all sorts of people with different styles. If you want to fix problems, come to me… but know that nothing comes quickly. There is no magic in ping pong. Just keep playing.”</p> <p>Miro is over seventy now, and he had a forty-year break from ping pong. But he still comes back to play. When I’m partners with someone in ping pong, I apologize a lot for missing shots. But Miro says, “Don’t be sorry. You play beautifully.” I do make beautiful shots. I know that cognitively, but not deep-down. Because when I play ping pong, I focus on the one in ten shots missed, not the nine out of ten shots made.</p> <p>I played doubles with Miro and a woman named Lynn. Lynn is competitive; she’s the type of person who will look like she wants to throw her racket down when she misses a shot. In watching Lynn, I feel the ridiculousness of my own rage. I too have such feelings, like the anger and self-flagellation of missing a crucial serve.</p> <p>I remember talking something similar with my friends Leon and Alicia. We talked about how during a “performance,” the feeling of tension and stress can be overwhelming. But the reason I play ping, and the reason Leon said he plays piano, is for the joy of the art-form itself.</p> <p>But such anger is self-defeating and egotistical. To play well, you must have your wits about you. And you must enjoy it (the key word is <em>play</em>). I reflect that changing how I react to my emotional impulses and changing how I react to a bouncing ping pong are similarly difficult. Such change happens slowly, bit by bit, not all at once. Patience. I learned this Chinese proverb lately:</p> <p><em>It’s easy to change mountains and rivers, but hard to change a person’s nature. 江山易改 本性難移.</em></p> <p>Okay, my final thought. Roger Federer did a commencement speech at Dartmouth last spring. He shared an interesting statistic. In the height of his prowess as world champion, he won 80% of his matches. But in all those matches, he only won 54% of the points. He reflects on two take-away lessons:</p> <ol> <li>Four percent can be the difference between great and average.</li> <li>Even the greatest tennis player in the world loses 46% of points. He too has to learn to move on gracefully from failure.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ping pong"/><category term="personal"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Miro was an Egyptian table tennis national team player back in his heyday.

Needless to say this is a rather stress-inducing question – one that for the most part, I prefer not to talk about. Unless the other person has some actionable help they can provide, or I value their emotional support. For the most part this is not the case; people ask about the job search flippantly, as if they’re just “checking in”. Of course, some people can provide resources or connections. Some people have great advice for mental fortitude – so it’s not all bad.</p> <p>One reason that “how’s it going” is a hard question to answer is because progress is a multi-faceted thing to measure.</p> <p><strong>Tangible progress.</strong> This is what people typically expect when they ask me about the job search. In their head, the process goes like this:</p> <ul> <li>Decide what you want to do -&gt; Apply like crazy -&gt; Land interviews with whoever gets back -&gt; Choose the least bad of those options</li> </ul> <p>I’m not gonna make some bold claims about how that’s the wrong way to think about things, and I’m not going to suggest some competing framework that is miles better.</p> <p>But do want to share about the <strong>intangible progress</strong>. I’ve made some of this, here’s what it looks like:</p> <ul> <li>Survey knowledge. Learning about an industry, the different companies around, the types of roles available. It’s hard to “measure” how much knowledge you’ve gained in a certain area, and harder still to distill it to a friend or stranger at a moment’s notice.</li> <li>Self-understanding. After learning about what is out there, there’s the question of, “what do I want to do?” This question does not have a simple solution, like the equation x + 5 = 7. If it did, then I would’ve solved this years ago in Algebra 1 (believe me). Self-understanding comes over time, over many conversations, slowly. And the process is never quite complete. I may get a job and find it doesn’t quite fit me. The process of self-understanding continues throughout your life. My parents, who worked for decades and are now retired, face the challenge of self-understanding. There’s a number of ways you can fill your time when retired – it is genuinely hard to contemplate what <em>you</em> really want to do.</li> <li>Conviction. Garnering conviction is the process of developing motivation to proceed along a certain path. If on Day 1 you are very unsure what to do, but you have an inkling that Option A is the one you want to proceed with; then on Day 30, you may have found more and more things about Option A that excite you. You may also speak the lingo of Option A, and know how it compares to Option B and C. Again, it’s hard to quantify how much conviction you have for a certain direction. And it’s something that comes in waves.</li> </ul> <p>Writing this out like I just did, it occurs to me that this progress is real stuff. There is real research and decision-making that has to be done to pursue an intentional career change. It takes contemplation and reflection. But I fear when people ask about my job search, they’re not quite ready for a spiritual journey. Or maybe they are! And I should just prep them better. To steel-man my case for intangible progress, here are some other ways it counts:</p> <ul> <li>Startups. Startups spend plenty of time assembling a time, picking a direction and assessing the market before they start earning revenue. That period of building, testing, and experimenting is key. An example is Meta: when they were just Facebook, they went many years before they had any idea of how to monetize their platform. Focusing on results too early can harm the business in the long-term.</li> <li>Book writers. Consider the task of writing a fantasy novel like Harry Potter. The premise and world-building is essential to that story’s success (my thinking for this is that JK Rowling books following Harry Potter pale in comparison). Arguably, most of the important work for Harry Potter happened before she even wrote the first page.</li> <li>AI compute overhangs. ChatGPT was released in 2022, but the technology actually been possible for maybe 8-10 years before that. In 2016, tons of <em>intangible progress</em> had been made on artificial intelligence. It was illegible to the general public how amazing these capabilities were, which is why ChatGPT came to be seen as such a breakthrough.</li> </ul> <p>Steve Dalton describes this phenomenon in the 2-hour job search. He says that while we know 85% of jobs are gotten through networking, people feel pressured to <em>look like</em> they’re working hard on the job search. And that means essentially wasting time sending apps through job board portals. Building a network and having conversations with people doesn’t necessarily make quantifiable, linear progress towards your goal, but it is the research-supported method for finding a job.</p> <p>(If you’re then going to ask me “how many conversations have you had this week?” please just don’t. It’s annoying and unhelpful. Most people don’t want to be asked about work, because they think about it already so much. So don’t ask unless they bring it up.)</p> <p>Now, I’m not saying tangible progress doesn’t matter. I’d certainly love to have a slew of interviews and job offers my way. But realistically, that won’t happen unless I’m committed to a career goal and ready to make it happen. Like many things, you can go too far the other way – and I also don’t want to be lounging around “contemplating” for months on end. But frankly, my personality is too stressy to ever do that.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="personal"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting a job hunt now, some of my friends ask me how it’s going.

Searching for food and creating shelters were the equivalents of a day-job. With no laws, kingdoms, or strong institutions, people could work however much they want. Life may have been better in that sense. But the work was hard and dangerous.</li> <li>Agriculture displaced hunter-gathering societies. Agriculture allows you to grow much more food for fewer man-hours. Agriculture existed alongside hunter-gatherer civilizations (for instance, in North America, the Aztec civilization fluorished in modern-day Mexico, while the Native American tribes continued in the modern-day US). The agricultural revolution arguably resulted in a dis-improvement the quality of people’s lives. Work became monotonous, boring, and it enabled a more stratified society. At the same time, agricultural societies allowed people to specialize in labor. With smaller numbers of people tending to food production, others could focus on science, technology, governance etc.</li> <li>The industrial revolution was the next major change in production. Machines and assembly lines got so good, that hand-crafted goods were made uneconomical. Whereas agriculture allowed for mass production of food, the industrial revolution allowed for mass production of almost everything else: cars, clothes, human capital (the modern-day education system is a product of Victorian English education system). <ul> <li>Societies that underwent the industrial revolution certainly had the edge. They could create guns and weapons, expand empires. So in a sense, you could avoid industrialization, but only for a time. There were some benefits to everyday people, like cheaper clothes or whatever.</li> <li>The industrial revolution certainly had negative consequences: <ul> <li>Carbon emissions began in earnest</li> <li>Labor exploitation of children and adults</li> <li>Increasing concentration of wealth to owners of capital. Hence, Karl Marx wrote his seminal work <em>Capital</em>.</li> <li>The cruel, abhorrent industrial-scale abuse of animals.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Many people across the world now still work in factories or some form of blue-collar work. So these issues are very still present.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Throughout these revolutions, we see a pattern of certain forms of labor displacing others. Work in agricultural societies replace work in hunter-gatherer times. Work after the industrial revolution replaced work before that. But throughout all of it, work and jobs still exist.</p> <p>Now, the present. We are living through a period of rapid technological change.</p> <p>Let’s say for argument’s sake that the present era started with the invention of the computer. Since then, there’s been a variety of major transformations in global society: - computers &amp; robots making processes more efficient. Right now, computers don’t <em>do</em> much for you, but they make many things you want to do much faster. Hence, almost every job in service-based economies is mediated by computers. - extremely low cost of communication &amp; information. The internet allowed people to learn almost anything online, and communicate with almost anyone. There’s some good consequences (Wikipedia, Khan Academy, educational YouTube) and some bad (social media, polarization, misinformation). - the wide-scale availability of mobile computers (smart phones). So computers are not just used in our work lives, but our personal lives too.</p> <p>And lastly, the major development of the post-computer era is artificial intelligence. By that I mean a system capable of doing “thinking” in some sense of the word. Thinking with logic and reason is what defined the Enlightenment Era, and what separates us from non-human animals. Artificial intelligence, however, could change the status quo. It could mean that very soon, we won’t be the best thinkers on this planet. In short, artificial intelligence threatens to supplant human <em>cognitive labor</em>. This is what underpins my predictions for the short, medium and long-term future.</p> <p>In the short-term…</p> <ul> <li>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) will gradually get integrated into tools that we already use. Google docs, google sheets, software development, medical diagnosis. <ul> <li>In some industries, like software or business operations, this will happen very quickly.</li> <li>In industries with greater inertia – licenses, government regulation – it will happen slower. For example, governments, non-profits, law, medicine are all fields where there is less incentive to change.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In time, even the best doctors, lawyers and accounts will start to use GenAI. It saves so much time and provides such a competitive advantage, you simply must. Those who don’t will be dinosaurs within months or years. But it won’t happen overnight. ChatGPT 3 came out over two years ago. But it has barely been integrated into most people’s day-to-day lives – even computer software! It feels as if this integration should happen overnight. But in reality, it doesn’t, even for transformational technologies.</li> <li>I think this stage started in late-2022 with the release of ChatGPT.</li> </ul> <p>In the medium-term:</p> <ul> <li>GenAI will do any and all job functions that require pure thinking. I’m talking accounting, law, programming, theoretical research.</li> <li>What is left for humans in this future? Plenty. Cognitive labor is only one part of most jobs in developed economies. Humans would then be better suited for: <ul> <li>emotional labor. Politics, activism, sales – anything that involves persuasion. Also, care-taking, nurturing, coaching, therapy. If you take a therapist, for instance, while the AI may provide great resources intellectually, humans have some advantage in being physically present for others. We also can hype ideas up and motivate others.</li> <li>physical labor. Fixing bulbs, doing factory work, taking care of children and the elderly all involves physical labor. Teaching young kids, like I did, is partially a cognitive task, but mostly a job that requires emotional skills and physical presence.</li> <li>capital allocation and risk. CEOs, professors etc. may not do direct work themselves, but they allocate capital and therefore are responsible when things fail. More and more jobs will look like this. You may outsource work to an AI, but you’re still responsible for the outcomes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What is work like in this world? <ul> <li>For me, it’s exciting and liberating to be freed from mind-numbing cognitive labor. Those with people-skills and the abilities to effectively use AI will benefit. Those that can’t transition may have trouble.</li> <li>The intelligence offered by AI is only useful if you work a white-collar job. What if you work in the hinterlands of America – mining or factory towns? What if you work in a shoe factory in Vietnam? Sadly, AI is not going to liberate anyone from those jobs. At least, if we confine ourselves to cognitive general intelligence.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Some predict we will reach this level of artificial super intelligence (intelligence that exceeds the best of humans) by 2027. But I still think it will take years or decades for GenAI to truly seep into every industry in every country across the globe (just like it took decades for electrification to be truly ubiquitous).</li> </ul> <p>In the long-term:</p> <ul> <li>What can the AI given enough time? <ul> <li>Embodied AI (ie. humanoid robots) can do <em>any</em> job (physical, cognitive, emotional) that a human can. Probably better, cheaper and faster.</li> <li>AI will design and conduct full-on scientific experiments, advancing the state of the art in R&amp;D and manufacturing.</li> <li>AI will run governments – ideally optimizing for human and animal welfare.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What’s left for humans? <ul> <li>In this theoretical world, humans would be left to do jobs that have essentially no function in society. Everyone would just be like a retiree in Florida – killing time on the golf course, in painting class, and at dinner parties.</li> <li>Realistically, there would be work to do, chiefly in politics. Who’s to say which AI system we should put our faith in? What values should the AI be optimizing for?</li> <li>We’ve had steadily increasing average incomes for decades, but poverty has not gone away, and many curable diseases take lives every year. These are not technological problems – they are political. Work would be there to distribute the benefits of AI across the world, and orient the AI so it benefits the climate and animals.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What about work? <ul> <li>Right now, there is enough wealth in the world for <em>everyone</em> to have ample food, shelter, and medical care. Yet that is not how the world operates. It has been the case for hundreds of years that you need to “work” to live (in the US, at least). We should expect the status quo to continue, no matter how dramatic the changes are in technology. For a work-free future, major political activism has to happen to create a 4-day work week etc. Or you can move to other countries where such futures are closer to reality.</li> <li>That said, work would hopefully be more enjoyable. It may just involve making art, playing live music, or organizing humanoid robots to do your bidding. There may be “work” to be done in colonizing the stars, melding our minds with machines, etc. Who knows?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>So those are my predictions for the long-run. But let’s not forget the relevant Keynes quote, “in the long-run, we’re all dead.” In this case, we may be dead because of run-away uncontrolled AI. Or alternatively, AI may bring about next Guilded Age with <a href="https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/">astronomical wealth</a> inequality, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson">political assassinations</a>and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5047584-bernie-sanders-blasts-elon-musk-spending-deal/">tycoons running politics</a>. Who knows?</p> <p>Frankly, the upside of AI is just so great. And anyways, Pandora’s box has already been opened. People have seen what AI is capable of, so there’s no going back. It’s only a question of when. In the meantime, our job is to work on the issues of democratic governance, just allocation of wealth, and rights for all living creatures. The rest should sort out itself.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ethics"/><category term="social-change"/><category term="ai"/><category term="technology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[To understand the future of work, it helps to think briefly about the history of work. in pre-historic times, “work” was hunter-gathering.

And your coworkers, boss, customers – whoever. When I landed in Kaohsiung for the first time, my interactions with the quarantine hotel I was staying at were mediated through LINE, the common messaging app in Taiwan &amp; Japan. Most of the time, I would type something, they would respond, and then send a sticker.So many stickers. A sticker is like a glorified emoji that moves. Or you could see it like sending a meme or a GIF. And you can also buy them. And they make stuffed animals and key-chains based on the common ones.</p> <p>Honestly, I think we need more of this in the West. As I re-acclimatize to American culture, I realize how much warmth and nuance we’re missing out in with the purely textual medium.</p> <p><strong>Hope and change.</strong> What’s something that Obama, Trump, and Bernie all have in common? They acknowledged the struggle of working people in America. Obama’s 2008 campaign, “Change we can believe in.” Bernie in 2016, “Not me, us.” (with messaging about a “political revolution”). And Trump said he would “Make America Great Again” and “drain the swamp”.</p> <p>Trump’s populist messaging struck a chord with the American people, and I hope that the Democrats take note. The Democrats came off this year as out of touch, patronizing, and fake. Yes, sure, maybe sexism and racism had something to do with it. But I think really the problem is lack of authenticity.</p> <p>Trump is authentic. He speaks his mind. He’ll say things other people are afraid to say. Given polls skew towards the Democrats, it seems like there’s a number of shy Republicans out there. Why is that? Trump is also, as it happens, a master of the media. He used two attempted assasination attempts to his great advantage. Apparently, there was some photo of him working at McDonald’s that went viral. He bought the support Elon, who – whether you like it or not – made the Republicans seem a lot cooler. And he chose a convincing, well-spoken vice-presidential candidate to add in the mix.</p> <p>I do think the Democrats needed the 2024 election as a kick in the butt. If the stakes really are as high as they said, then they should be fighting a whole lot smarter. This isn’t just about more campaign dollars. The Presidential election is about picking a phenomenal candidate, and finding a message that *really* clicks with people. I sometimes feel like the Harris campaign was run in a way that made them feel satisfied with the effort they put in, but in actuality wasn’t at all competitive. Now people may disagree.</p> <p>The point is that there’s much we can learn from how the Republicans won the hearts and minds of people across the country. Without this temperature check, would we liberals have any idea how much people are hurting? People are losing their stable jobs, they’re afraid of automation and AI, and the cost of living is going up and up. This happens in fully blue states just as much as it happens in purple or red counties. So something has seriously got to change.</p> <p><strong>Bible-pusher Rohan.</strong> Before I moved to Taiwan, I was fanatical about this book, <em>The Defining Decade</em> by Meg Jay. The lessons of this book are left for another blog post. Certain books like that can really reshape my world-view. That book in particular wasn’t saying anything crazy or marvelous, but rather putting oft-repeated advice in a new perspective – one that I had an easier time digesting. It galvanized me to do something different and original: move to Taiwan and be an English Teacher. My thoughts at the time were would give me “identity capital”: a story, a set of experiences that make me a memorable human being. At the very least, it’s evidence that I can go against the grain, and follow through on something off the beaten path because it makes sense to me.</p> <p>These days, I’ve been thinking about the job search. There’s a whole slew of tips and tricks online, but that doesn’t make the job search any easier. Most of the people I’ve talked to took months to get anywhere. If you think about it, most people have only ever job hunted a few times in their life. Sometimes less. So people’s experience is limited; it is by nature anecdotal. There’s some old parable about the seven blind men that try to draw an elephant. Basically, they each touch different parts of the elephant, but with such a limited scope, they can’t get the whole picture of what the creature looks like.</p> <p>Two years ago, I recommended <em>The Defining Decade</em> to anyone and everyone. Now, I have a new Bible: <em>The 2-Hour Job Search</em> by Steve Dalton. This book is more easily summarized: instead of shooting resume after resume into the black hole of job application portals, your time is better spent networking at targeting companies by informational interviews to learn about your industry. Moreover, Dalton provides explicit instructions on how to implement this strategy. No generic tips &amp; tricks – just actionable advice, based on research and his experience as a career counselor. I like this book because it flips the traditional paradigm on its head. And god, there’s a lot of vague advice for job searching, but very few people who actually know how to do it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="legacy-blogger"/><category term="taiwan"/><category term="politics"/><category term="social-change"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was originally posted on blogger.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">the spectrum of agency</title><link href="https://tohab.github.io/blog/2024/2024-12-the-spectrum-of-agency/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="the spectrum of agency"/><published>2024-12-09T03:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-09T03:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tohab.github.io/blog/2024/2024-12-the-spectrum-of-agency</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tohab.github.io/blog/2024/2024-12-the-spectrum-of-agency/"><![CDATA[<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger.</em></p> <p>If you were a rich person in the 1800s, would you used cotton shirts made by slave laborers? If you were a German in the 1940s, would you used soap made by the bodies of the victims of the Holocaust? If you were alive in the 2000s, would you have eaten the flesh of dead animals.</p> <p>Agency is how much choice we exert over our lives. The answer to those three questions for most people is maybe not, but probably yes.</p> <p>Humans are designed to go along with the stream of water that is society. We are social creatures, and are generally agreeable. I think so, at least; we are more similar than we are different. If we had too much heterogeneity, there would be more social activists, perhaps, but also more serial killers, racists, and social pariahs. Like birds flying in the sky, moving with your flock is a helpful instinct. Obedience and conformity to social expectations is what lets the world run day-to-day.</p> <p>On the other hand, humans also have an innate capacity for courage, creativity, and uniqueness. These are the qualities that create social disruption, change, and innovation.</p> <p>There’s a balance to be had. Conformity helps build great, stable nations; but too many and we’re on the road to serfdom. Disruption fuels technological progress; but too much and we’re in a land of warlords feuding over power.</p> <p>Social expectations appear in more mild senses too. For instance, the idea that you should stay till the end of a concert instead of leaving halfway through. Good, or bad? Good to respect the performers. Bad because you may be driving yourself crazy. People may come on different sides of this debate, and it’s probably a case by case situation.</p> <p>Here are some other pieces of conventional wisdom:</p> <ul> <li>“Don’t play wrong notes.”</li> <li>“Do what I tell you to do.”</li> <li>“Make sure you plan ahead.”</li> </ul> <p>These are actually all good pieces of advice, I think. But who’s to say when these rules of thumb get out of hand? Conventional wisdom also told people it’s okay to abuse slaves, slaughter Jews and eat the flesh of animals. For every piece of advice, there’s a counter-adage that might be equally valid.</p> <ul> <li>“Don’t play wrong notes.” &lt;–&gt; “There are no wrong notes in jazz.”</li> <li>“Do what I tell you to do.” &lt;–&gt; ““Be yourself!”</li> <li>“Make sure you plan ahead.” &lt;–&gt; “Be in the moment!”</li> </ul> <p>Vegetarians and animal activists know this conflict intimately. How often have you been invited to eat a piece of meat, and feel like you “should” out of courtesy or politeness – but also feel like you “shouldn’t” perpetuate violence against innocent creatures.</p> <p>It’s up to all of us to decide how much we follow social convention, and how much we exert our own agency. Expressing myself through my choices typically brings me join, and so here are a few ways I like to do it:</p> <ul> <li>Arranging your living environment to be tidier.</li> <li>Choosing to focus on your breath.</li> <li>Brushing your teeth, or flossing to satisfaction.</li> <li>Installing Linux. I did this recently – It brings me great joy. *So* much better than Windows. It feels like I have a whole new computer. And there’s so much more choice and freedom on my laptop, now, which I had very little of on Windows.</li> <li>Wearing clothes you like, or thrifting for nice stuff.</li> <li>Creating art or music without thinking of whether it sounds “good”.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="legacy-blogger"/><category term="philosophy"/><category term="ethics"/><category term="social-change"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was originally posted on blogger.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lessons from Travel</title><link href="https://tohab.github.io/blog/2024/2024-11-lessons-from-travel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lessons from Travel"/><published>2024-11-12T04:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-12T04:26:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tohab.github.io/blog/2024/2024-11-lessons-from-travel</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tohab.github.io/blog/2024/2024-11-lessons-from-travel/"><![CDATA[<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>See many perspectives.</strong> While traveling I met a young Israeli sniper on the beaches of Siargao, Chinese nationalists who argue passionately in defense of the Chinese system, conservative French people who hate social welfare but also use it to travel. Keeping cool, curious, and empathetic is hard when you have different beliefs to someone.</li> <li><strong>Overcome social anxiety.</strong> So often when traveling, asking the nearest person is the best way to get the most accurate information. It’s essentially a necessity to be bold enough to do this. I think I’m relatively good at doing this but I still have reluctance sometimes that doesn’t serve me. Talking to a stranger is a subclass of “jumping into cold water” – doing something you know has to be done, but you dread and keep procrastinating. I can think of many things that induce a similar feeling: quitting a job, packing up your things, breaking up with someone.</li> <li><strong>See different societies and how they differ.</strong> Even between Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, there were vastly different languages and governmental systems. I learned about Laotian government incompetence; Vietnamese national pride (so many communist flags!); and the laissez-faire Thai labor economy.</li> <li><strong>Learn what is essential to carry.</strong> My friend Dean brought a yoga block (like a styrofoam brick) that he used for meditation and sitting when the ground is uncomfortable. Surprisingly useful! I brought ziploc bags with me to label my things. And a nail clipper. Know thyself.</li> <li><strong>How to make choices with little information.</strong> This is so crucial. So crucial. Where is this bus going? Should I trust this tuk-tuk driver to take me to the ferry port? Why is there a “terminal fee” when I’ve already bought a boat ticket? Will my bag be overweight or just right? Is this vegetarian soup also vegan? So many cases of not knowing the full story – having to go by someone’s word and just laughing along. On the internet and in America we live in a high-information environment. You can look up anything. It is much harder to look up specifics of traveling in certain places abroad (especially in China – that’s like a whole other universe). So we rely on incomplete information. We pray to the travel gods when we have done all we can. We know that things will be okay so long as you have your passport and wallet and your life.</li> <li><strong>How to be kind to people under duress.</strong> Lack of sleep, 14-hour bus journeys, decision fatigue, tired of looking up vegan food. But then it’s always better to be nice to the next person you cross paths with. Patience under fire.</li> <li><strong>How to stay calm.</strong> Deep, slow belly breaths. There’s a book about it.</li> <li><strong>How to get information from people, and know what information sources to trust.</strong> Asking people where they recommend to go in a city. Deducing their vibe, thinking about whether you’ll like what they like. Chumming up with people, appreciating them when they help you out. Knowing people’s love languages – though most of what I give is kind words and hostel fees. Much more art than science.</li> <li><strong>Make plans that are specific but also flexible.</strong> I realized early on that having a hostel booked for at least one night is a good bet. Otherwise, remain flexible!</li> <li><strong>Adjust plans when necessary.</strong></li> <li><strong>Be in touch with your feelings about physical environments and people.</strong> Recognizing when you’re not vibing with a place and want to move on. Recognizing when the crew you’re with is not your crew, and you should kindly excuse yourself.</li> <li><strong>Communicate without a shared language.</strong> Smiles. Pointing. Gesturing. Extensive Google Translate.</li> <li><strong>Express gratitude.</strong> Traveling with just ten kilograms on your back, gratitude is often all you can give.</li> <li><strong>Self-advocate, ask for what you need.</strong> Even when someone’s paid to help you, like a hostel front desk staff, asking for something you need is difficult. And it is tiresome to always be reliant on someone else – but, well, that’s life. I hope one day I can pay this forward, and help others who rely on me.</li> <li><strong>Appreciate where you’re at.</strong> We travel the external world to explore our inner worlds. The most beautiful places can be so difficult if you’re not feeling it. Conversely, the raunchiest places can be hilarious and beautiful if you are appreciating it.</li> <li><strong>Mental endurance, persistence.</strong> All the things I mentioned above are harder when it’s month 3 or 4 of traveling.</li> <li><strong>The courage to go against the grain.</strong> When I was traveling, I had just one good friend, Dean, who was doing so at the same time. Long-term backpacking is not something most people do. The tenacity and courage it takes to do it is substantial. It also takes courage, I say to myself, to not have a job lined up, and hope that things will work out in the end.</li> <li><strong>Make trade-offs: money, comfort, time, safety.</strong> Decisions, decisions. So many of them while traveling. No routines, only moving forward. Exhausting!</li> <li><strong>How to kill time/wait when you need to.</strong> Talking to people. Reading my Kindle. Podcasts.</li> <li><strong>Ground yourself in a new physical environment.</strong> (e.g. via routine, exercise, putting luggage in a certain way). No routines but mini-routines. I had my bags set up so they felt familiar. A place for everything, and everything in its place, my dad likes to say. In the same vein, mini-routines in the morning, or a set time to go foraging for food, or having a hot beverage.</li> <li><strong>Accepting there will be mistakes.</strong> In Hong Kong, I thought it was way too pricey and bought too many groceries. I lost my hat and never went back to look for it. I got overcharged for a train booking. Mistakes are human, and I am human. It is part of life to make missteps, and these missteps do not define you. That’s a tough lesson.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="legacy-blogger"/><category term="personal"/><category term="travel"/><category term="reflection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was originally posted on blogger.]]></summary></entry></feed>

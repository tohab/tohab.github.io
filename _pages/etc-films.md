Sometimes I record random YouTube that are somewhat entertaining.

Here's a story I performed with my friend Leon about an unusual tour bus experience shortly after we moved to Taiwan. Performed with First Person Story at the West Berkeley Fencing Club on April 11th, 2025. Thanks to Dean Wyrzykowski for filming!

#### 補習BAND

I recorded 補習BAND (buxiband) album in Taiwan with Leon Chou, Etienne Lalonde, and Noé Largeron. I played alto saxophone on most tracks, and also some flute and voice. We recorded on June 4th, 2023. More details on the tracks and backstory are written in [buxiband post-mortem](https://www.rohanprasad.org/blog/2023/2023-11-band-album-is-out/).

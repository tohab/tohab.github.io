Welcome to the creative wing of the site. Each section dives into a different medium I love to explore.

### Music
Notes on the songs, albums, and performances that move me, coupled with embeds and playlists so you can listen along.

### Films
Context for the films and video essays I am recording, plus curated links to what is inspiring the work in progress.

### Games
An evolving archive of lightweight browser games and interactive toys that I am prototyping for the web.

Welcome to the creative wing of the site. Each section dives into a different medium I love to explore.

### music
notes on the songs, albums, and performances that move me, coupled with embeds and playlists so you can listen along.

### films
context for the films and video essays i am recording, plus curated links to what is inspiring the work in progress.

### games
an evolving archive of lightweight browser games and interactive toys that i am prototyping for the web.

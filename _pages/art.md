Welcome to the doodle wing of the site. Each section dives into a different medium I love to explore. Looking for recordings? Head over to the new music page in the nav bar.

### films
context for the films and video essays i am recording, plus curated links to what is inspiring the work in progress.

### games
an evolving archive of lightweight browser games and interactive toys that i am prototyping for the web.

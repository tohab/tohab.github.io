**I'm Rohan!** I'm a writer, creator, and thinker navigating the 21st century.

**About me.** I grew up in London and went to UC Berkeley for college. After college, I lived in Taiwan for two years where I taught English and learned Mandarin. I'm back living Berkeley, California. I now work at [Constellation Research Center](https://www.constellation.org).

For fun, I love to write (semi-regularly) on this blog, bike, run, play the alto saxophone and strum acoustic guitar. 

**On this site** you can find my blog (started in 2019). There's also a portfolio of projects I've led throughout my career.

<!-- I was born in the year 2000, so my Chinese zodiac is the dragon. I grew up in the UK, and went to school called *The American School in London*. I moved to the US to attend college, and graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Economics. At Berkeley, I did a lot of animal rights activism, sang in an a capella group, published an economics paper, and helped found a vegan coop. After graduating, I moved to Kaohsiung, Taiwan to teach English and learn Mandarin, Chinese. I enjoyed teaching a great deal, but thought I should try something else after two years. Right now, I'm pondering my next steps! -->

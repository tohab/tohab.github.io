##### I'm Rohan! This is my personal website. Here you can find my blog and homepage.

##### I grew up in London, UK and went to UC Berkeley and studied Economics. After that, I lived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan for two years working as an English teacher.

To-do with regards to the blog:
- delete the http:// ugly tag from legacy blogger posts
- change the intro on legacy blogger posts to just be *This was originally posted on blogger.*
- reduce the gap above headers, especially h1 
- eventually, write a script that automatically adds tags to all posts

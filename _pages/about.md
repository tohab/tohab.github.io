**I'm Rohan!** I'm a writer, creator, and thinker navigating the 21st century.

**About me.** I grew up in London and went to UC Berkeley for college. After college, I lived in Taiwan for two years where I taught English and learned Mandarin.

Now I live in Oakland, California. I love to run, bike, and juggle. I write semi-regularly on this blog. My primary instrument is the alto saxophone, though I dabble in voice and guitar.

**On this site** you can find my blog, which contains writing since 2019. On my Youtube, I have a [jazz album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wevUja0L6m8&list=PLLmNtQG2epzFG2PwtDTz4U9OVDCsiJGG8).

<!-- I was born in the year 2000, so my Chinese zodiac is the dragon. I grew up in the UK, and went to school called *The American School in London*. I moved to the US to attend college, and graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Economics. At Berkeley, I did a lot of animal rights activism, sang in an a capella group, published an economics paper, and helped found a vegan coop. After graduating, I moved to Kaohsiung, Taiwan to teach English and learn Mandarin, Chinese. I enjoyed teaching a great deal, but thought I should try something else after two years. Right now, I'm pondering my next steps! -->

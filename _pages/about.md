##### I'm Rohan! This is my personal website. Here you can find my blog and homepage.

##### I grew up in London, UK and went to UC Berkeley and studied Economics. After that, I lived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan for two years working as an English teacher.

<!-- To-do with regards to the blog: -->
<!-- - reduce the gap above headers, especially on the blogs browsing page -->
<!-- - eventually, write a script that automatically adds tags to all posts -->

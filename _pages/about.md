I'm Rohan! I'm a writer, creator, and thinker navigating the 21st century.

Some things I like to do:
- Run, bike, and juggle.
- Write on my blog, talk with friends.
- Play alto saxophone. I also dabble in flute, voice and guitar.

<!-- I was born in the year 2000, so my Chinese zodiac is the dragon. I grew up in the UK, and went to school called *The American School in London*. I moved to the US to attend college, and graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Economics. At Berkeley, I did a lot of animal rights activism, sang in an a capella group, published an economics paper, and helped found a vegan coop. After graduating, I moved to Kaohsiung, Taiwan to teach English and learn Mandarin, Chinese. I enjoyed teaching a great deal, but thought I should try something else after two years. Right now, I'm pondering my next steps! -->

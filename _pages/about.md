<summary><strong>About me.</strong></summary>
  <div class="collapsible-panel__content" markdown="1">

I was born in New Jersey in 2000. When I was two, my family moved to the UK, 
and I ended up attending the [American School in London](https://www.asl.org/)) until graduating high school.

After that, I went to the University of California, Berkeley and studied Economics. 
I got involved in the animal rights movement at Cal, revitalizing a student group ([BOAA](https://boaa.studentorg.berkeley.edu/)), 
and founded a vegan cooperative group house.

After college, I decided to move to Taiwan to study Mandarin and teach English. I taught ages 7-14 and quite enjoyed it!

I've been living in Berkeley, California, for about the past year. 
Since April 2025, I've been working [Constellation](https://www.constellation.org).

For fun, I love to write on [this blog](/blog/), bike, run, play the alto saxophone, and strum acoustic guitar.

<!-- I was born in the year 2000, so my Chinese zodiac is the dragon. I grew up in the UK, and went to school called *The American School in London*. I moved to the US to attend college, and graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Economics. At Berkeley, I did a lot of animal rights activism, sang in an a capella group, published an economics paper, and helped found a vegan coop. After graduating, I moved to Kaohsiung, Taiwan to teach English and learn Mandarin, Chinese. I enjoyed teaching a great deal, but thought I should try something else after two years. Right now, I'm pondering my next steps! -->
